ABSTRACT: Family businesses are enterprises characterized by a specific, broad set of goals of family and business nature, which can be in conflict with each other. The purpose of this article is to examine the impact of selected ownership-related factors on the process of setting the goals of family businesses, and more specifically, on the choice between alternative family and business goals. The data necessary for the analysis was collected through surveys of 300 family businesses managers. The hypotheses were verified using the non-parametric chi-square test. The analyses carried out showed that, of the determinants studied, the family’s share in the ownership of the business (whether family members are the only owners or whether there is a non-family partner in the company) is the greatest importance, while the number of family owners (one vs. at least two) does not significantly affect the choice between goals. This article makes an important contribution to research on family business, as it shows the role of family ownership factors in the process of choosing between alternative family and business goals. Such an approach is not very popular in the literature on the subject, but it is a valuable addition to existing approaches. © 2024, Czestochowa University of Technology. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: This study uses enterprise data from Ethiopia, a developing country, to contribute to a relatively underexplored topic on determinants of cooperative formation and their performance vis-à-vis conventional enterprises. We find that cooperatives are more likely to be formed by entrepreneurs who have low human capital and limited within-family entrepreneurial experience and less likely to engage in capital accumulation and in upgrading, which has implications for their long-term prospects. As a result, they are less efficiently operated, earn lower profits, and grow much more slowly than conventional enterprises. Our results cast doubt on the viability of using cooperatives to support business development and entrepreneurial transformation. © 2024 The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Research methodology: The case study is based on field data including semi-structured interviews with the main protagonist and related stakeholders of Karan Handicraft, a leather craft artisan enterprise. After informed consent, the interviews with the craft artisan entrepreneurs of Karan Handicraft were conducted, transcribed and analysed verbatim in the respondents’ native language, Kutchi Gujarati. The authors also used archival data given by the company. In addition, secondary data from industry reports and business magazines was used to create the case. Case overview/synopsis: The case investigates the impact of digital technologies on the small handicraft artisan entrepreneurs by focusing on a family-run business of a leather craft. It traces the evolution of Karan Handicraft, based in Kutch district of Gujarat, India from the year 2007 to 2023. The third-generation artisan entrepreneur Karan Marvada attempted exploring the new-age social media platforms to showcase the products, modified his product designs to attract a new customer-base and adapted to digital marketing. However, in the wake of the crowding in the handicraft cluster, the central business problem that Karan was grappling with was, if he should scale up his artisanal entrepreneurial stint using electronic commerce (e-commerce) as a medium. Another allied issue is in such a scale-up, should he use e-commerce, i.e. as a medium of communication only or as a medium of both communication and delivery. While the latter may lead to scale, it may raise the challenge of not being able to preserve the traditional values of his ancestral business. Complexity academic level: This case involves various issues that arise in entrepreneurship management, such as decisions related to growth strategy (remain small and unique vs become large and mass scale), to maintain a physical presence vs digital presence and the form of digital presence, are dwelt upon. The case is aimed at graduate students in an entrepreneurship or family business course. It could also be taught in other courses that focus on innovation and social entrepreneurship. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: This paper determines the profile of a family business that ensures the greatest engagement of family members in running a family business and has the strongest impact on the competitiveness of such an enterprise and its organisational effectiveness. The theoretical part addresses organisational effectiveness. It emphasises the variety of criteria and areas of its assessment and the relationships between organisational effectiveness and competitiveness. It discusses familiness as a unique resource and competitive advantage of family businesses. The analytical part presents the research methodology, including the authors' formula for calculating the measure of familiness and the procedure for identifying the profile of a family business, ensuring the greatest familiness engagement in business activities, which affects the organisational effectiveness and competitiveness of family businesses. This procedure was based on applying the gray system theory (GST). The research was based on the incomplete numerical induction method on a targeted sample of 200 family businesses operating in Poland that met the research criteria. The results show that the features most responsible for the highest engagement of familiness in the family enterprise are the territorial scope and size of the company, and the age of the family member involved in the activities of the enterprise. Small and medium-sized enterprises operating on the domestic market, in which a family member aged 36-45 is involved, generate the highest level of familiness in all seven researched areas of organisational effectiveness, including in the area of goals, and also generate the highest level of competitiveness of family businesses. © 2024 Tomas Bata University in ZlÃ­n.

ABSTRACT: Inter-generational succession in family enterprises influences internal governance models, and their relationship is mediated by the successor's socialization process. Drawing on the enterprise capability theory, the author employed a survey method to examine the relationship between cognitive assets held by family enterprise successors and two governance modes. The findings confirm that tacit knowledge, relational networks, and entrepreneurial spirit among family enterprise successors positively influence their socialization roles, thereby triggering governance adaptation. Specifically, relational governance is continuously strengthened, while contractual governance exhibits an inverted U-shaped trend. Organizational conventions play a positively moderating role in this influencing process. This study extends the application boundaries of enterprise capability theory, deepens the understanding of enterprise cognitive systems, enriches the literature on the relationship between relational and contractual governance, and provides theoretical foundations for inter-generational governance in family enterprises. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Like most organizations, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) generates a lot of data of varying types, from clinical to staffing and operations. However, these datasets are separated, preventing effective analytics. To improve workforce management and care delivery, CHOP's Nursing department collaborated with the Data & Analytics team to create a dashboard-based platform for analyzing workforce metrics and patient outcomes, aiding nursing leaders in decision-making. This project involved multiple phases with contributions from Nursing, Data & Analytics, CHOP's Data Trust Office, and Human Resources. Key performance indicators were identified, and a variety of data sources were aggregated to provide a comprehensive view of the nursing enterprise. The resulting platform offers automated, current, and reliable analytics on various aspects, including nursing demographics, education, survey results, staffing actuals by job group, and patient and family experience data. The platform's usability was assessed using a modified Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Scale survey, with a 29% response rate primarily from senior directors and managers. The findings showed high usability and satisfaction, indicating the dashboard is a valuable decision-support tool. Lessons learned include the need for analytics education for nurses and mid-managers, the inclusion of critical nursing-specific metrics (and development of the data pipelines making them possible), and the integration of multidisciplinary team metrics for comprehensive nursing analytics.  © 2024 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Organizations use business process management systems to automate processes that they use to perform tasks or interact with customers. However, several variants of the same business process may exist due to, e.g., mergers, customer-tailored services, diverse market segments, or distinct legislation across borders. As a result, reliable support for process variability has been identified as a necessity. In this article, we introduce the concept of declarative process families to support process variability and present a procedure to formally verify whether a business process model is part of a specified process family. The procedure allows to identify potential parts in the process that violate the process family. By introducing the concept of process families, we allow organizations to deviate from their prescribed processes using normal process model notation and automatically verify if such a deviation is allowed. To demonstrate the applicability of the approach, a simple example process is used that describes several variants of a car rental process which is required to adhere to several process families. Moreover, to support the proposed procedure, we present a tool that allows business processes, specified as Petri nets, to be verified against their declarative process families using the NuSMV2 model checker. © 2024 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The marginalisation of female entrepreneurs in accessing credit is well documented. Yet, how female entrepreneurs navigate through the marginalisation to gain funding is under-explored. Design/methodology/approach: The authors address this gap using qualitative data from 30 female entrepreneurs in three neighbourhoods with varying socio-economic characteristics in Ghana's capital, Accra. Findings: The authors find a marked aversion to bank loans among respondents. Consequently, they nurtured trust in their social circles in order to facilitate access to informal credit from internal (e.g. family and friends) and external (e.g. trade credit, associations and religious organisations) sources. This aversion to loans from formal financial institutions (FFIs) had a socio-cultural aspect, including cumbersome application procedures, a deep-rooted fear of the social consequences of defaulting and religious prohibition against interest payment for Islamic traders. Social implications: This paper shows that providing formal access to credit is not enough to support women's entrepreneurship if the socio-cultural factors inhibiting women's access to credit from FFIs are not addressed. Originality/value: The findings suggest that trust is an important factor that bridges the gap in female entrepreneurs' access to funding given their heavy reliance on informal sources of funding.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This perspective article addresses the essential need to comprehend what artificial intelligence (AI) entails and how it can revolutionize the family business sector. Design/methodology/approach: This article presents a literature review and the authors' perspectives to unravel the potential benefits of AI in family businesses. Findings: It is crucial to understand what AI is and its various types before the authors can discern which AI tools can be beneficial or tailored to family businesses. A promising area for future research is the use of Theory of Mind AI, which can help minimize conflicts of interest among family business members and assist in clear decision-making and succession planning. However, integrating AI brings about ethical implications, such as data privacy concerns, the need for transparency in AI decision-making and the necessity to ensure fair AI practices. These are all critical issues that the future research will need to tackle. Originality/value: This article emphasizes the potential of AI to be customized and incorporated to tackle the distinct dynamics, obstacles and opportunities prevalent in family-owned businesses. It also proposes future research areas that could enhance the application of AI in such enterprises. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: While digitalisation has significant implications for environmental management activities, this nexus has received minimal attention in research. Given this backdrop, this study uses a unique survey dataset of 386 micro and small enterprises (MSEs) and conducts an OLS regression analysis to examine the impact of digitalisation on environmental management activities. The study also investigates how family ownership moderates this relationship. The study finds that digitalisation supports environmental management activities as an important strategic mechanism, and that family ownership has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between digitalisation and environmental management activities. This study contributes to ‘institutional theory’ by highlighting its applicability to the new context of MSEs in emerging markets. Further, the study provides managerial insights into how to ensure environmental management practices in the digital age. © 2024 The Authors.
