AB  - The capacity to analyze risk and launch construction and civil engineering enterprises that are at once hazardous and precisely suited to the shifting economic conditions is what is known as entrepreneurship. The promotion of entrepreneurship has recently risen to the top of the priority list for public policy in the majority of industrialized nations. Technical entrepreneurs with a solid education are crucial for the economic growth of any country. To maintain a competitive advantage in an innovation-driven global economy, it is crucial to nurture entrepreneurial skills. Students, policymakers, and educators are starting to realize the importance of high-quality entrepreneurship education and training in discovering and developing this entrepreneurial potential in young people. Younger generations are now showing a growing tendency and enthusiasm in starting their own businesses. However, our educational system is set up to produce more job seekers than job producers. A complicated phenomenon, entrepreneurial growth is the crystallization of a person’s social milieu, family-ingrained views, caste system, educational attainment, parental income, occupation, and other factors. Additionally, educational institutions might encourage students to pursue self-employment in a good way. The goal of this study on the entrepreneurial spirit among civil engineering students is to determine the reasons why people choose entrepreneurship as a career and to look into the effects of various variables on students’ preference for entrepreneurship. This study is based on the aforementioned context. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to explore how emotional intelligence (EI) in members of family businesses can enhance the relationships with the stakeholders and whether adopting a relationship marketing approach could extend a family businesses' longevity, the businesses' success through generations. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-method approach was adopted, and two studies (quantitative followed by qualitative) were conducted in Mexico on small to medium-sized enterprises. This study considers the perspective of owners and employers of family businesses. Findings: The study provides important insights into the relationship between EI and relationship marketing. Enhancing EI in family members whilst conducting a relationship marketing approach, both internal and external, will result in better performance. Family businesses can alleviate conflicts inherent to family emotions whilst building and maintaining strong relationships with customers and suppliers that can secure the long-term success of the organisation by enhancing EI. Originality/value: Considering the majority of the literature is focussed on highly developed economies such as the USA, the UK and major developing economies such as China and India, this mixed-method study offers Mexico as a novel setting that has become an important procurement hub in light of the recent global developments and international relationship policies. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Firms seeking to embed sustainability into their core business strategy face inherent tensions of managing conflicting goals of performing on economic, social, and environmental dimensions, in the short- and long-term. Hahn et al. (2014) argue that managers that view these tensions as a paradox may consider radical strategies but end up adopting prudent strategies because they are unable to implement workable solutions due to higher awareness of uncertainty and risks. We argue that subjective interpretation of temporal depth and directionality influences the adoption of sustainable development strategies. Firms with long-term orientation that adopt an overarching vision, structures to incorporate diverse perspectives, and guardrails to prevent tunnel vision, are better positioned to balance financial and non-financial goals. Multi-generational family enterprises with aspirations for transgenerational continuity draw selectively upon their historic past to prepare for success in distant future. When focused on balancing wealth creation for their families and communities, they have the potential to unleash creativity and innovation for a sustainable competitive advantage. © 2024 Universidad de Malaga.

AB  - Research methodology: The case is based on data collected from in-depth interviews, and from company, third-party and regulatory–agency documents. In addition to prior conversations over several years between the company founders and the lead case writer, there were several rounds of interviews in 2023 with the surviving founder and in-depth interviews with eight of the company’s key managers. Company documents reviewed included bylaws, organization charts, profit and loss statements and staffing statistics, all from founding to sale. Also reviewed were documents and evaluations of company operations and performance produced by the merger & acquisition firm that handled the company’s eventual sale. The company owner insisted on complete disguise of the company and all its members and prohibited disclosure of detailed proprietary financial data. Case overview/synopsis: At the strategic level, this case is about how the unique, complex and changing healthcare environment created opportunities and threats to which a women-owned and run start-up company, Aloe Health (AH), had to respond to become and remain successful. At the personal level, the case illustrates what it takes for an entrepreneur and leader having clinical but no real business acumen to start, expand and turn around a company and ultimately position it for a successful acquisition, continually learning and adapting along the way. The case describes how two women who were friends for many years started up a home healthcare company later in their lives and grew it into the largest women-owned business of its kind in the USA. Based in the Southwest USA, an area with many factors conducive to success, they navigated the many complexities of US Medicare regulations to create a fully-integrated home healthcare company providing unskilled personal care, medically skilled homecare and end-of-life hospice services to thousands of clients. The case provides background on the founders and the home healthcare industry context, and details the steps taken to start up and build the company into a fairly successful enterprise; one of the largest of its kind in the region. The (A) case ends with one of the founders facing a crisis brought on by the death of her co-founder and the revelation of some significant organization dysfunctions, leaving her unable to profitably exit the company and unsure of whether she would be able to turn things around. The students are tasked with making recommendations for what she should do next. The (B) case brings events up to fall 2023, describing the steps the surviving founder took to transform her leadership style and the company’s systems and culture, and to navigate the due diligence process associated with preparing for an (ultimately very successful) acquisition. It also shares the owner’s “lessons learned,” and briefly notes the current state of the acquired company and the many AH employees that it continues to employ. The case provides ample information for students to appreciate the company’s strategy and the challenges of operating in the highly regulated health care industry. However, it is probably even better suited to illustrating the “soft” issues of new-venture management, such as the tendencies of founders to overload themselves by micro-managing their growing venture and not adapting to expansion, and for those with clinical backgrounds to focus on caring for patients and employees while overlooking business essentials and organization systems. It also illustrates how business partnerships among strong-willed individuals can produce dynamics in the founding team similar to a “marriage,” with affection and complementary talents, yet also tensions. It further illustrates the process of a successful turnaround strategy, and the “due-diligence” challenges of preparing for an acquisition. Complexity academic level: This case has a range of course applications at multiple education levels. Although it is probably best suited for graduate and executive-level programs, it can also be selectively used in undergraduate classes, particularly if populated by upperclassman. It is ideally suited to courses on entrepreneurship and on healthcare management. For an entrepreneurship course, it could be positioned mid-way through the semester, after covering topics relating to the entrepreneurial mindset, founding teams and business models. It can be used to get the class focusing on competitive issues and the challenges of starting up a company in a highly regulated environment, on entrepreneurial founding-team characteristics and management tendencies (e.g. micro-management control tendencies), on transition issues from start up to growth stages and on exit strategies. We believe this case is also well suited as a teaching exercise for students pursuing healthcare management studies in baccalaureate and graduate programs (MBA, MHA, MHS) in which instructors wish to broaden student exposure to a real-world scenario that focuses on entrepreneurial behavior in a healthcare setting (a topic of increasing interest to healthcare practitioners and managers given the current trend toward provider formation and ownership of health facilities). Here, the case may be used to focus on the complexities of the healthcare industry, the key differences between various healthcare service business models and on the challenges that technically (clinically) trained professionals often face when trying to manage a healthcare business. Ideal placement of the case would be in a capstone course, after students have been introduced to their functional coursework in topics such as introduction to management, organizational behavior and leadership, financial management and strategic thinking. The case also challenges students to apply knowledge obtained in specialized coursework in healthcare systems and policy, industry regulation, as well as healthcare reimbursement methods. The case also may be used in organization behavior courses to focus on team, cultural and leadership issues and in strategic management courses to focus on strategy implementation. In addition, there are enough family business themes in the case (even though Aloe is not actually a family business) to use it in a course on managing family businesses. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of government support and technology usage on family business entrepreneurial intention. The paper also investigates the moderating impacts of gender on the family business entrepreneurial intention with its two predictors. Design/methodology/approach: This paper has used both resource-based view and dynamic capability view theory as well as literature on family business entrepreneurship to develop the theoretical model. Later, the theoretical model has been validated using structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) with respondents from Indian family business enterprises. This study has used a purposeful and convenience sampling approach. Findings: This study has shown the significance of technology usage as well as government support to improve the family business enterprise. The study highlights that there is a moderating impact of gender on the relationship between government support and technology usage with entrepreneurial intention in family business. Research limitations/implications: This study adds value towards body of literature in entrepreneurship, gender, and business, as well as family business literature. The study shows how gender acts as a moderator in case of family business entrepreneurship. The study is cross sectional in nature and has limited number of respondents from India. Thus, the findings cannot be generalizable. Originality/value: This study is a unique study as it investigates the influence of both government support as well as technology usage by the family business firms for entrepreneurial intention. The proposed theoretical model has a high predictive power which makes the model effective. Moreover, this study also examines the moderating impacts of gender on entrepreneurial intention in the family business which adds value to the existing body of knowledge. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The integration of digital technologies and processes presents a multifaceted and complex challenge for family firms, as they must navigate new technologies while maintaining their unique familial attribute. Moreover, the issue of intergenerational inheritance adds an additional layer of complexity, as succession must be effectively executed to ensure the continued success and survival of the family firm in the digital age. Together, these challenges pose a significant threat to the sustainability and competitiveness of family firms. To gain a deeper understanding of how these challenges can be effectively addressed, the study utilizes data from the 2016 Chinese Private Enterprises Survey to identify the factors influencing family firms' digital transformation and the role of entrepreneurs' characteristics in this process. From the perspective of intergenerational inheritance, the study finds that both the willingness of entrepreneurs to hand over power and the willingness of their children to take over firm power have a moderating effect on the relationships between entrepreneurs' characteristics and firms’ digital transformations. This study also verifies the heterogeneous effects from the type of business digitalization, location of the firm, and educational level of the children. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - At present, family businesses face the challenge of governance transformation. Due to the Chinese unique “family culture” and the imperfect market of professional managers, the pan-family management of professional managers has become the key to the transformation of the family business in China. However, the existing pan-family management of family businesses doesn′t seem to have been implemented effectively and has stimulated contradictions, such as competition for control. Several family businesses tried to implement the pan-family management but only got unsatisfactory outcomes. The reasons for the such phenomenon haven′t been explored clearly. Apparently, there is still a gap in the research on the pan-family management of professional managers. In response to the current research status, it is necessary to study the factors that influence the pan-family management of professional managers. This study aims to explore the relationship between family identity and pan-family management. Meanwhile, this study also tries to find out the reasons for recent unsuccessful cases of pan-family management. From the perspective of family identity, it can be seen that pan-family management may be contrary to the “family” cultural concept of the family business. Based on the perspective of organizational identity, this study suggests that pan-family management may lead to conflicts and contradictions between the generalization of family identity and family members′ demand for family identity control. The study uses the data from the National Private Enterprise Sample Survey 2010(Ninth) to explore the impact of the maintenance of core-family identity and the maintenance and continuation of family ownership identity on the pan-family of professional managers. Besides, this study also explored the impact of formal organizational systems on pan-family and their role in regulating family identity on pan-family. Thus, this paper proposes six hypotheses to be tested: H1: The stronger the family intention of the business owner, the more challenging to implement pan-family management; H2a: The degree of involvement of family shareholders harms pan-family management; H2b: The willingness of family inheritance harms pan-family management; H3: The improvement of the formal organizational system has a positive effect on pan-family management; H4a: The improvement of formal organizational system will weaken the negative effect of maintenance of the core family identity on pan-family management; H4b: The improvement of formal organizational system will weaken the negative effect of the maintenance and continuation of family ownership identity on pan-family management. The method of this study is the OLS Hierarchy Regression. Empirical results show that the strong family intention of the business owner, the degree of involvement of family shareholders, and the willingness of family inheritance are not conducive to the pan-family of professional managers, which indicates that the maintenance of the core family identity and the maintenance and continuation of the family ownership identity might go against the pan-family of professional managers. The results also show that the formal organization system plays an essential role in the realization of pan-family transformation. The formal organization system is conducive to improving the degree of pan-family. Meanwhile, the perfection of the formal system also weakens the negative influences of the maintenance of the core family identity and the maintenance and continuation of the family ownership identity on pan-family management. This study offers three theoretical contributions to pan-family and family business research literature. Firstly, from the perspective of organizational identity, this paper explains why the pan-family management of the family business is challenging to implement and clarifies the family identity factors in family businesses that hinder professional managers from pan-family management. The more attention family business pays to family identity, the more difficult it is to break the original family boundaries for pan-family. In addition, this paper deepens the understanding of how family business introduces professional managers to realize effective governance transformation. Meanwhile, this paper expands the logical relationship between family management and professional management in the family business. It shows that the perfection of the formal system is conducive to pan-family management; thus, the family relational culture and management professionalization may have a symbiotic relationship. Finally, the results of this study also have certain reference value for family businesses to make governance transformation decisions. © (2023). All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Research on family businesses' risk-taking behavior generally assumes that family businesses are risk averters. However, most of these studies have focused on one single decision, ignoring the fact that family businesses need to make multiple risk decisions in certain cases. Based on the perspectives of narrow-framing and broad-framing in prospect theory, this paper examines the risk appetite of family enterprises in corporate venture capital investments. We focus on two key risky decisions in corporate venture capital activities - the number of investments and venture relatedness and propose that family businesses tend to adopt risk-diversification strategies to control the overall risk. Therefore, there will be positive relationships between the number of investments and venture relatedness. Moreover, such relationships will be moderated by the type of family firm. Analysis of 180 largest Chinese manufacturing listed family companies supports our hypotheses, confirming a need to take the heterogeneity of family firms fully into account. © (2023) by Aussino Academic Publishing House All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore how social entrepreneurship empowers women and how it influences the existing gender based intersectionalities in the society. This paper is based on a single case study of a social entrepreneurial startup called “Pahal,” which used social entrepreneurial strategies to encourage women to engage in economic activities, which helped them in gaining economic empowerment. Design/methodology/approach: The researcher alongside the social entrepreneur visited the field for eight months from August 2016 to March 2017 and interviewed multiple stakeholder-employees (as partners) of the social enterprise. This study was done by conducting interviews with all the stakeholders in all the three social entrepreneurial phases, i.e. pre-Pahal, during-Pahal and after-Pahal. The interviews and observations were recorded and analysed using social entrepreneurial lens and intersectionality. Findings: “Pahal Initiative” – is a social entrepreneurial intervention that helped the women in the household to start a food delivery business with the support of the social entrepreneur. Consequently, women gained confidence and self-respect. The attitude of men in the household changed when the women in the household generated additional income. It impacted their position and status which led to an increase in their participation in decision-making in the household and economic independence. The women become more interactive and expressive in a predominantly patriarchal household. Within one year, the entrepreneur had to stop the Pahal initiative. Then, this study observed and recorded that this event curtailed the economic activities undertaken by the women in their village and their social status reverted to what it was before the initiative. Practical implications: First, social entrepreneurial strategies lead to economic value creation and lead overall socio-economic gains. Second, social entrepreneurial strategies address the problems of patriarchy and gender discrimination. Third, economic activities undertaken by women changed the social perceptions of the family members towards women in the families. Social implications: From this case study, one observes that social entrepreneurship has a strong potential to bring about social and economic change. This study helps policymakers and non-governmental organisations to solve poverty and gender discrimination related problems using social entrepreneurial strategies. Originality/value: This study uses social entrepreneurial intervention to understand and bring about change in the socio-economic status of women in rural India. This study uses an intersectionality lens to make sense of the data, reality and reflects on how intersectional positions are altered when women are economically empowered either through training or through a proper organisation or both. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - SMEs contribute significantly to the economy but have inconsistent growth and high mortality rates. Authors intend to comprehend the dynamics arising out of product-mix, markets, and governance affecting SME performance. Two hundred responses were obtained using a questionnaire. Cluster analysis was adopted for investigation. For each cluster, Bayesian-Pearson-correlation and Bayesian-linear-regression were carried out to determine the associations that were not explicit (frequentist approach). Results imply that a standard policy does not suit all SMEs and requires different prescriptions. Manufacturers of fixed type-of-products and those operating in the export-market show greater stability. Family businesses have slower growth rates but better customer-relations. Overtime and delay due to changes in production scheduling are two main ailments. None of the SMEs are lean and resilient. SMEs be categorised on their stage in the organisational life cycle, market it operates, ownership, type of product, supply-chain, and operations philosophy for better policy making.

AB  - Inter-generational succession in family enterprises influences internal governance models, and their relationship is mediated by the successor's socialization process. Drawing on the enterprise capability theory, the author employed a survey method to examine the relationship between cognitive assets held by family enterprise successors and two governance modes. The findings confirm that tacit knowledge, relational networks, and entrepreneurial spirit among family enterprise successors positively influence their socialization roles, thereby triggering governance adaptation. Specifically, relational governance is continuously strengthened, while contractual governance exhibits an inverted U-shaped trend. Organizational conventions play a positively moderating role in this influencing process. This study extends the application boundaries of enterprise capability theory, deepens the understanding of enterprise cognitive systems, enriches the literature on the relationship between relational and contractual governance, and provides theoretical foundations for inter-generational governance in family enterprises. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study intends to critically assess the mainstream enterprise support service provider agencies in Glasgow. A topic fits with the conference track “Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Family Business—Women entrepreneurship”. The literature review suggested that enterprise support agencies tend to not only lack engagement with displaced women entrepreneurs (Mwaura, S., Levie, J., Lassalle, P., Stoyanov, S., & Carter, S. “Taking Steps to Combat Barriers to Ethnic Minority Enterprise in Scotland” 2018; Edwards et al., 2016; UNHCR, 2021; Savazzi et al., 2020; Abebe, in J Small Bus Econ 60:315–350, (2023) ) but also displaced women entrepreneurs do not trust these agencies (Nijhoff, K., (2019) “Support Programs for Entrepreneurial Refugees in the Netherlands. An Overview of Practical Experience”, The Hague University of Applied Sciences. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342040577_SUPPORT_PROGRAMS_FOR_ENTREPRENEURIAL_REFUGEES_IN_THE_NETHERLANDS_An_overview_of_practical_experiences. (Accessed on 18th 03. 2023).; Bikorimana & Nziku, 2022). A qualitative research study based on semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with seven mainstream enterprise agencies responsible for providing business support services in Glasgow was conducted. These study findings reveal poor engagement due to immigration constraints; lack of social network; as well as lack of contact with displaced women entrepreneurs. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - Generational transition and change reflected in innovation are crucial for the continuity of family businesses. Most of the changes are made as the generational transition progresses, having at least two generations interacting. This study analyses change management in the context of intergenerational interaction to answer the question: How to drive change so that it takes place and generates positive results for family businesses? A multiple case study design was adopted to analyse three situations of change with a sharp contrast in their results in three agricultural enterprises. A framework that examines the rational, emotional, and contextual dimensions of change processes was used to explain the results. Change was found to be more easily accomplished when: I) a sense of psychological ownership encourages new generations to contribute new ideas; ii) change generates immediate and easily visible results; iii) the number of family members involved is low; and iv) the context provides funding opportunities. In turn, change produces positive results when it is preceded by open and cognitive conflict, and when the context offers opportunities to access knowledge networks. This work is a unique piece in the sense that it analyses the management of change during intergenerational interaction, an almost permanent situation that is little studied in innovation processes in the context of family businesses. © 2024, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - Using agency and stewardship theory, we study the impact of family ownership on the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the context of internal and external governance mechanisms. Employing a sample of all SME exchange-listed firms from their inception to 2018, we use a three-stage least squares (3SLS) estimation method to account for the endogeneity of the ownership−performance relationship. We find a positive bi-directional relationship between performance and promoter ownership, with no moderating impact of internal governance. However, when external governance mechanisms operate, the performance–ownership relationship shows mixed results, supporting the impact of culture on firm performance. The study contributes to the debate on the ownership−performance relationship by analyzing small firms in the emerging economy of India. Regulators need to be cognizant of the cultural nuances before implementing corporate governance codes for small firms. One-size-fits- all regulations will not apply to every firm. Regulators should consult with small business owners to come up with norms that would ensure good corporate governance practices in small listed firms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Family business owners derive socioemotional wealth from their enterprises. Socioemotional wealth consists of the non-economic benefits for the owners, including family influence on the business, the social bonds of the family with the community, and multigenerational family legacy. Many of these non-economic factors have yet to be explored within the context of ethnic family businesses, which present a unique context to explore both the antecedents and implications of socioemotional wealth. The current study examines the relationship among ethnic minority family business owners’ strength of ethnic identification, socioemotional wealth, and ethnic brand promotion. Our study aims are threefold. First, we contribute to the evolving research on family businesses’ marketing strategies by exploring how family business ethnicity intersects with socioemotional wealth and strategic marketing decisions. Secondly, we extend socioemotional wealth literature by examining its nomological network to quantitatively test an antecedent to ethnic family businesses’ socioemotional wealth (i.e., the strength of ethnic identification) and a marketing consequence of socioemotional wealth (i.e., family business brand promotion). Lastly, we extend the family business literature in the context of an understudied yet prevalent population (i.e., ethnic family businesses). This study establishes a significant positive relationship between the strength of ethnic identification and socioemotional wealth and between socioemotional wealth and ethnic brand promotion. Notably, product ethnicity moderates the latter relationship such that the congruity between product ethnicity and family business ethnicity increases ethnic brand promotion. The results show that socioemotional wealth has a significant positive relationship with the firms’ marketing strategies that emphasize family business ethnicity. In other words, the higher the socioemotional endowment of an ethnic family business owner, the more likely the business will brand its products ethnically. Further, managerial and theoretical implications for ethnic family business marketing are discussed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Research Summary: We integrate social learning theory with gender role congruity theory to propose that family firms gain more from female leadership than nonfamily firms due to the congruence of female communal values with those of a family business. Results of our empirical study, based on a sample of 322 Spanish small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), show that while all three dimensions of learning orientation (commitment to learning, shared vision, and open-mindedness) are positively related to an entrepreneurial orientation, significant differences exist based on the CEO's gender and whether the SME is a family or nonfamily firm. Strongest differences were found between female-led family and nonfamily SMEs whereby the entrepreneurial orientation of female-led family SMEs benefited significantly more from their firm's commitment to learning and open-mindedness. Managerial Summary: To cultivate entrepreneurship, a small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) leader must create an organization that fosters learning. Yet, surprisingly, we know little about male and female leaders' ability to translate their SME's learning into entrepreneurship. Our study reveals that in comparison to nonfamily firms, family firms offer an environment that is more conducive to supporting women leaders, which allows their female leaders to direct their SME's learning more effectively toward entrepreneurship. However, while female-led family SMEs were as effective as male-led family- and nonfamily-led SMEs in directing learning toward entrepreneurship, female-led nonfamily SMEs struggled. Our study therefore suggests that while women have an advantage leading family SMEs, gender biases hamper female leaders' ability to transform learning into greater entrepreneurial orientation in nonfamily SMEs. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Learning outcomes: The learning outcomes of this study are as follows: 1. understand the role of financial inclusivity in the sustainable development of a nation; 2. examine the concept of social entrepreneurship and identify the skills needed to be a social entrepreneur; 3. analyze the opportunities and challenges faced by social entrepreneurs, especially in an emerging economy; and 4. assess the feasible options with respect to upscaling and expansion. Case overview/synopsis: Yamuna Sastry, a young woman from a traditional Indian family, had set out to achieve her dream of financial inclusivity by helping the underprivileged in her country gain financial independence and credibility. When she was approached by a cab driver to file tax returns for him, a new venture took shape in her mind, and along with a partner, CabDost, a socially driven financial advisory start-up was created to provide financial advisory services exclusively for cab drivers. CabDost had been instrumental in making over 15,000 cab drivers financially literate, instilling in them a culture of compliance, getting them tax refunds and enabling the Indian Government recover eight crores in taxes. The success of financial inclusivity among cab drivers inspired CabDost to extend its financial services to truck drivers, auto drivers, housekeeping staff and other contractual workforce. The company found it challenging to address the demands of the increasing customer base with its available technical resources. The absence of an in-house tech team and the need for an all-in-one tech platform to provide a wide variety of financial services induced CabDost to explore other options. Dvara Money, a neo bank offering financial services, approached CabDost with a merger proposal. Though it was a lucrative offer, the founding members were apprehensive as they knew that most of the mergers failed because of myriad reasons. They were contemplating on their next move as they were in a dilemma about whether to develop a technical team in-house or to go ahead with the merger. Complexity academic level: The case can be taught to business management students as a part of the introductory course on entrepreneurship or social entrepreneurship. The case can be used specifically to make the students understand the role of financial inclusivity in the sustainable development of a nation, the concept of social entrepreneurship, the journey of social entrepreneurs in the financial inclusivity space, right from ideation to execution, the challenges faced in the bargain, survival mechanisms adopted and the various options available for further growth and expansion.

AB  - This paper determines the profile of a family business that ensures the greatest engagement of family members in running a family business and has the strongest impact on the competitiveness of such an enterprise and its organisational effectiveness. The theoretical part addresses organisational effectiveness. It emphasises the variety of criteria and areas of its assessment and the relationships between organisational effectiveness and competitiveness. It discusses familiness as a unique resource and competitive advantage of family businesses. The analytical part presents the research methodology, including the authors' formula for calculating the measure of familiness and the procedure for identifying the profile of a family business, ensuring the greatest familiness engagement in business activities, which affects the organisational effectiveness and competitiveness of family businesses. This procedure was based on applying the gray system theory (GST). The research was based on the incomplete numerical induction method on a targeted sample of 200 family businesses operating in Poland that met the research criteria. The results show that the features most responsible for the highest engagement of familiness in the family enterprise are the territorial scope and size of the company, and the age of the family member involved in the activities of the enterprise. Small and medium-sized enterprises operating on the domestic market, in which a family member aged 36-45 is involved, generate the highest level of familiness in all seven researched areas of organisational effectiveness, including in the area of goals, and also generate the highest level of competitiveness of family businesses. © 2024 Tomas Bata University in ZlÃ­n.

AB  - This research examines the unique learning process of the Igbo Apprenticeship System (IAS). This approach to the development of enterprises and entrepreneurship, originated in the ethnic group of communities in the Southeastern part of Nigeria, uses mimetic learning to instil in its participants’ knowledge and behaviours intended to create a lifelong approach and mindset to entrepreneurship development. This form of mimetic learning predates the mediaeval era and takes place outside the formal educational system. As a consequence, it largely does not rely on participants having a specific level of educational achievement. Rather it requires a long-term commitment from the apprentice, their family and the entrepreneur. The research expands the theoretical understanding of entrepreneurial learning through an evaluation of an entirely experiential base using the Mimetic Theory and Institutional Logics as the critical lens to explore the antecedents of entrepreneurial intention and social learning. It evaluates and combines the available evidence into a conceptual framework that shapes the process of entrepreneurial learning as an experiential activity. Qualitative data were gathered from 40 former and current apprentices and critically analysed using the illustrative case study and process tracing approach. The research contributes to the extant entrepreneurial learning process literature by identifying, reviewing and synthesizing available research into a conceptual framework that explores the process of entrepreneurial learning as an experiential process. It also highlights effective mechanisms of skills transfer and business training, contributing to the literature on informal/vocational training and human capital development. Key issues in entrepreneurship education including the different informal learning processes of the IAS and the identification of specific dynamics in the interaction and development of the learners were examined. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Family businesses often lack sufficient knowledge about digital business model innovation digital business model innovation (BMI). This study's purpose was to analyze how and when organizational readiness for digital innovation exerts a positive impact on family businesses' digital BMI. To do so, the authors examined the mediating effect of the familiness learning mechanism and the moderating effect of family involvement on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative survey method was used to collect the data for this study. Using a sample of 282 family businesses involved in manufacturing in China, the authors conducted hierarchical regression analyses to evaluate the authors' theoretical model. Findings: The results of this work demonstrate a positive relationship between organizational readiness for digital innovation and family businesses' digital BMI, and the find that the familiness learning mechanism mediates this relationship. The findings also show that second-generation family involvement in management moderates the direct effect of organizational readiness for digital innovation on the familiness learning mechanism, as well as the indirect effect of organizational readiness for digital innovation on digital BMI via the familiness learning mechanism. Moreover, the results establish that family involvement in ownership moderates the direct effect of the familiness learning mechanism on digital BMI, as well as the indirect effect of organizational readiness for digital innovation on digital BMI via the familiness learning mechanism. Practical implications: This study provides practical contributions to the literature on family businesses and to public policy, providing concrete suggestions for fostering digital innovation in family enterprises. This study also enriches our understanding of the unique conditions by which family businesses can successfully implement digital BMI. Originality/value: This research confirms that organizational readiness for digital innovation is an antecedent of digital BMI. This finding offers a new perspective that helps explain what might lead family businesses to engage in digital BMI. This study also places the familiness learning mechanism into a theoretical framework, which expands the current understanding of how organizational readiness for digital innovation facilitates digital BMI. Moreover, this work provides new insights into the boundary conditions by which organizational readiness for digital innovation affects the digital BMI of family businesses in terms of second-generation family involvement in management and family involvement in ownership. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Enterprise resource planning (ERP) has a significant impact on modern businesses by enhancing productivity, automation, and streamlining of business processes, even accounting. Manufacturers can assure proper functioning and timely client demand using ERP software. Coordination, procurement control, inventory control, and dispatch of commodities are all features of supply chain management. Manufacturers may design better logistics plans with this capability, which will substantially aid them in lowering operational and administrative expenses. In this article, we instigate the idea of neutrosophic soft γ-open sets (NSγ-open sets) by employing the operation γ on the family of neutrosophic soft open sets written symbolically as τu in neutrosophic soft topological spaces. Additionally, by employing the operation on τu, we bring forth new notions namely NSγclosure, NSγ-interior, NSγ-regular space, NSγ-regular operation and obtain their characteristics in neutrosophic soft topological spaces. With the NSγ open sets, we discuss a methodology for overcoming the challenge of selecting the best ERP for a business firm. © 2023 J. J. Mershia Rabuni. All rights reserved.

AB  - The manufacturing sector is undergoing a significant transformation driven by the demand for personalised products, challenging manufacturers to provide precise quotations while maintaining cost control and profitability. Product Configuration Systems (PCS) play a pivotal role in supporting product configurations, facing challenges such as data integration, cost calculation relevance, and the need for a knowledge expression framework. This study significantly contributes by delineating an object-oriented ontology framework tailored for configurable product families within PCS. It incorporates comprehensive domain information models for MBOM, inventory, purchase, manufacturing, and sales and distribution. Additionally, the study proposes a domain information model-based cost estimation, integrating actual values from existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems for various cost aspects. Design patterns for transforming domain information models into system implementations are introduced, covering both data and business operation layers. Practical application and feasibility are demonstrated through a detailed case study, emphasising the method's practicality. The proposed approach empowers manufacturers to derive accurate product cost estimates, supporting well-informed business decisions. Future research directions involve refining product model configurations, expanding support for diverse product types, and integrating additional digital technologies for an enhanced user experience. Further exploration of labour, equipment, and engineering design expenses aims to enhance cost estimation accuracy. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The ability of a small and micro enterprise (SME) to recovery after a pandemic outbreak can directly affect national economic growth and sustainable development (Sustainable Development Goal 11). Thus, the current study quantitatively identifies, based on the spatial probit model, effective measures that enhance the performance and survival of SMEs after multiple waves of shocks induced by COVID-19. Additionally, this work explores the spatial correlation for post-pandemic recovery performance of businesses adopting a novel approach. Two field investigations were conducted in Dongguan City, in China, where questionnaires were released to 592 SMEs over a two-year period. The results obtained showed that the overall recovery performance of SMEs after the pandemic showed a positive spatial correlation, while this correlation varied at different local regions. More in detail, self-media marketing, borrowing money from family or friends, requesting bank loans and tax relief have been identified to be the key measures to effectively support the recovery and the increase chances for small businesses to remain operative after the pandemic. However, the success of these measures varies across businesses with different characteristics (owner's age and industry experience, primary market and business size, pre-pandemic financial condition). It is then suggested based on the results obtained that policy managers should formulate differentiated policies in terms of assistance measures for businesses targeting dissimilar characteristics as well as the needs of different regions, because those may have been impacted differently by the pandemic. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - As the core element of informal institutional environment, social trust has a complex and important impact on regional entrepreneurial activities. Due to the different social distance and communication objects, there are obvious differences in the form and mechanism of social trust, but the existing research rarely pays attention to the impact of the sub-dimensions of social trust on regional entrepreneurship. This study constructed a social trust framework from the three dimensions of universal trust, kinship trust, and institutional trust, and conducted an empirical analysis by using the panel data of the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) 2012-2018 and the micro data of enterprise industrial and commercial registration information. The research found that: 1) At the national scale, kinship trust significantly improved the activity of regional entrepreneurship, while universal trust and institutional trust had little impact on the entrepreneurial system. 2) The results of interaction effects show that there was a substitution effect between universal trust, kinship trust, and economic development; there was a complementary relationship between the effects of universal trust and government intervention on regional entrepreneurial activities; and institutional trust and government intervention showed a mutually reinforcing effect, which jointly promoted regional entrepreneurial activities. 3) Regional heterogeneity tests show that entrepreneurial activities in the eastern regions was less dependent on social trust; entrepreneurial activities in the central and western regions was positively influenced by universal trust and kinship trust; entrepreneurial activities in cities with good business-government relations was promoted by institutional trust, where the entrepreneurial policy dividend was effectively released; and in cities with average business-government relations, universal trust could significantly promote entrepreneurship and stimulate entrepreneurial vitality. This study focused on the impact of different dimensions of social trust on regional entrepreneurial activities, which enriches and expands the research on informal institutional environment and entrepreneurship, and has important implications for local enterprises to formulate entrepreneurial policies and optimize the entrepreneurial environment. © 2023, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

AB  - PURPOSE: Along with demographic changes, it is increasingly frequent that many mature people resign from their full-time jobs and decide to start their own businesses at a later age. Entrepreneurial activity among this group of so-called silver entrepreneurs can be caused by many motives, but these factors usually remain unknown to current employers or do not constitute a valid reason for understanding and keeping a mature person in the workplace. The purpose of this paper is to present new scientific results concerning entrepreneurial motivations, both internal and external, and the previous experiences of silver entrepreneurs from Eastern Europe based on an example from Poland. METHODOLOGY: We analyzed a unique sample of 1,003 owners of micro and small enterprises from Poland. The sample included only people over fifty. Our empirical study used a survey to explore the motivations and experiences of silver entrepreneurs that influenced their decision to start a business later in life. We linked attitude toward the behavior with motivation and utilized the “pull” and “push” factors. We utilized logistic regression to determine the factors related to starting a business above fifty. We also used the ordinary least square regression to determine the relationship between the explanatory variables and the age of starting a business by the respondents. FINDINGS: We found that the main “pull” factor positively influencing the start of business activity by silver entrepreneurs is the fulfillment of dreams as a broadly understood need for self-realization. However, the “push” factors (such as the occurrence of ageism in the workplace, as well as the loss of employment and lack of other opportunities on the labor market) significantly reduced the probability of starting a company at the age of over fifty. On the basis of the positive impact of a “pull” factor, it can be concluded that entrepreneurial activity at a later age is the result of opportunity-based entrepreneurship. Due to the negative impact of the job-loss factor, people made redundant started their business activity at an earlier age, before the age of fifty. Regarding external entrepreneurial motivations, the support received from family is the most important factor related to the individual’s environment affecting starting a business by silver entrepreneurs. However, the support from friends and the support from government bodies were not significant factors influencing starting a business at a later age.IMPLICATIONS: Findings from our study have implications for both employers and groups who support entrepreneurship. First, from the point of view of employers, the occurrence of ageism in the previous workplace could have resulted in resignation from full-time employment at an earlier age and a faster start of business activity. It is surprising that negative behavior towards older employees may also be associated with resignation from work by younger people. From the point of view of government bodies and other stakeholder groups related to the development of entrepreneurship, it is interesting that the support received from government bodies in conducting business activities was statistically insignificant for each group of respondents. This suggests the need to identify effective support and to design a comprehensive strategy for the development of silver entrepreneurship. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: The vast majority of previous studies used secondary data or focused mainly on Western Europe, in particular the United Kingdom, Finland, and France. Our contribution is to provide empirical evidence about the silver entrepreneurs from Eastern Europe, especially Poland. Our research included individuals who actually run their own businesses, opposite to previous studies that take into account people who are just considering starting a business. This is particularly important in relation to research on the entrepreneurial intentions of mature people to undertake entrepreneurial activities at a later age, and the real motivations of silver entrepreneurs. © 2023, Cognitione Foundation for the Dissemination of Knowledge and Science.

AB  - This study uses enterprise data from Ethiopia, a developing country, to contribute to a relatively underexplored topic on determinants of cooperative formation and their performance vis-à-vis conventional enterprises. We find that cooperatives are more likely to be formed by entrepreneurs who have low human capital and limited within-family entrepreneurial experience and less likely to engage in capital accumulation and in upgrading, which has implications for their long-term prospects. As a result, they are less efficiently operated, earn lower profits, and grow much more slowly than conventional enterprises. Our results cast doubt on the viability of using cooperatives to support business development and entrepreneurial transformation. © 2024 The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

AB  - The advent of digital transformation has profoundly impacted the diversified development of Chinese family firms. Consequently, this study investigates the influence of digital transformation on the diversification strategies of Chinese family firms, employing a sample of Chinese-listed family firms from 2016 to 2020. The findings reveal a significant contribution of digital transformation to the diversification of Chinese family firms. The analysis shows that second-generation involvement plays a moderating role, negatively affecting both digital transformation and diversification. Furthermore, the study highlights that the positive impact of digital transformation on diversification strategy is particularly notable among family firms characterised by low family authority and high innovation capability. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This book deals with a much understudied and poorly understood aspect of business: the role of owners and boards in value creation. While there is abundant guidance on value creation for publicly listed firms and their managers, the role played by owners, and their corporate directors, in value creation and governance has been overlooked. This book aims to fill that gap. • The first part deals with the mission, and the values and rules pertaining to the governance of the business. These structural elements are fundamental for owners to get right as they pave the way to value creation, or its opposite. They refer to “WHAT” owners have to do. Another element is the formation of the three boards that govern owner-led firms: the owners board, the board of directors, and the management board. • The second part addresses the relational elements that owners must master to effectively manage the social and emotional dynamics in their enterprise. It deals with the “HOW” of ownership, namely the leadership process that lies at the heart of board work. This process ensures alignment across the three boards and also with stakeholders that is vital to realizing owners’ value creating aims. • Thirdly, the book explores the histories, defining experiences, and talents that define owners and shape their enterprise. It concerns the “WHOM,” namely the identities of owners. It explores the diversity of ownership styles and identifies the critical personal transitions owners must make in their leadership quest. This book offers a practical guide for business aiming for value creation.

AB  - Purpose: This perspective article addresses the essential need to comprehend what artificial intelligence (AI) entails and how it can revolutionize the family business sector. Design/methodology/approach: This article presents a literature review and the authors' perspectives to unravel the potential benefits of AI in family businesses. Findings: It is crucial to understand what AI is and its various types before the authors can discern which AI tools can be beneficial or tailored to family businesses. A promising area for future research is the use of Theory of Mind AI, which can help minimize conflicts of interest among family business members and assist in clear decision-making and succession planning. However, integrating AI brings about ethical implications, such as data privacy concerns, the need for transparency in AI decision-making and the necessity to ensure fair AI practices. These are all critical issues that the future research will need to tackle. Originality/value: This article emphasizes the potential of AI to be customized and incorporated to tackle the distinct dynamics, obstacles and opportunities prevalent in family-owned businesses. It also proposes future research areas that could enhance the application of AI in such enterprises. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Research Summary: This study investigates formal institutional pressure from government policy, informal institutional pressure from filial piety, and their interaction effect on firms' internationalization strategy. We argue that, while influenced by independent policy and cultural effects, firms also exercise agency when responding to these competing institutional pressures. We find empirical support for the influence of policy and cultural effects on firms' foreign direct investment (FDI). We also find that, in making decisions about FDIs, state-owned enterprises are more sensitive to government policy, whereas family businesses are more sensitive to filial piety. Managerial Summary: This study reveals that firms' strategies in complex institutional environments are influenced by their needs for formal and informal institutional legitimacy. Managers can exercise agency by weighing the importance of formal and informal legitimacy differently and therefore vary in their responses to institutional pressures. However, managerial agency is bound by firm ownership type. Managers of state-owned firms prioritize formal institutional legitimacy, while their family business counterparts attend more to informal institutional legitimacy. Policymakers should be aware of this important difference between types of firms, which allows them to address noncompliance in a culturally sensitive and ultimately more effective way. © 2022 Strategic Management Society.

AB  - Purpose: The complexity of succession in family firms is multifaceted and can sometimes lead to turbulence. While structured succession strategies offer a roadmap for smoother transitions, intergenerational differences in family small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can lead to varied interpretations of an effective succession blueprint. This study synergizes the strategic entrepreneurship framework with the socioemotional wealth (SEW) perspective to probe into how formalized succession planning impacts performance in family SMEs. Furthermore, it delves into the mediating role of succession satisfaction, especially in family firms characterized by pronounced SEW and helmed by CEOs from different generational cohorts. Design/methodology/approach: Employing a comprehensive dataset from 1,833 global family businesses, this research utilizes bootstrapping regression models to discern the intertwined effects of mediator and moderator variables and their statistical significance. Findings: The main findings suggest that succession satisfaction does matter for a good succession process and that succession plans work only in family firms with a high degree of SEW and that are led by older family CEOs (e.g. baby boomers). Practical implications: The results offer fresh perspectives on succession processes, with a particular focus on how to improve the satisfaction of millennial family CEOs. Originality/value: The study uniquely combines strategic entrepreneurship and SEW to offer a holistic view of succession planning, highlighting satisfaction’s mediating role and SEW’s moderating influence. Additionally, it pioneers the incorporation of generational cohorts into the succession discourse. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This project aims to examine how entrepreneurial orientation and succession planning among Palestinian family businesses positively affects their associated growth potential, considering the mediating role of innovation and the moderation effect of geographic location. Leveraging ethnic entrepreneurship theory, the authors compare these types of enterprises in the USA with their counterparts in Palestine. Design/methodology/approach: This cross-sectional quantitative research analyzes data collected from October through December 2022. 180 Palestinian family-owned firms completed a survey; 90 companies were located in Palestine, while the other 90 were in the USA. Structural equation modeling analysis was conducted using Smart-PLS4. The interrelations of the conceptual framework were examined via path analysis and bootstrapping techniques. Findings: The authors found a statistically significant positive effect of entrepreneurial orientation on Palestinian family business growth; the authors’ results concurrently indicated succession planning did not affect growth within the authors’ selected population. The authors also discovered innovation mediates the relationship between orientation and growth, and business location appears to moderate this relationship. The authors’ research indicates geography appears to favor Palestinian family-owned companies in the USA, where the authors found opportunity-driven immigrant entrepreneurs benefit from the structured business systems in a highly-developed country. Originality/value: Given the current situation in Palestine, it is essential to understand the potential contribution that Palestinian family-owned businesses globally can make to reconstruct the country’s local economy. The next few years will be critical in figuring out how innovative thinking can boost the region’s recovery and increase Palestinian-based family companies’ ability to engage in sustainable entrepreneurship with reinvestment support from its diaspora. Therefore, it is important to have research that identifies factors that could improve these businesses’ continued performance and growth potential. This study also aids in further understanding the defining characteristics of Palestinian-owned family firms, enhancing general theories related to entrepreneurship among ethnic and diasporic groups. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Organizations use business process management systems to automate processes that they use to perform tasks or interact with customers. However, several variants of the same business process may exist due to, e.g., mergers, customer-tailored services, diverse market segments, or distinct legislation across borders. As a result, reliable support for process variability has been identified as a necessity. In this article, we introduce the concept of declarative process families to support process variability and present a procedure to formally verify whether a business process model is part of a specified process family. The procedure allows to identify potential parts in the process that violate the process family. By introducing the concept of process families, we allow organizations to deviate from their prescribed processes using normal process model notation and automatically verify if such a deviation is allowed. To demonstrate the applicability of the approach, a simple example process is used that describes several variants of a car rental process which is required to adhere to several process families. Moreover, to support the proposed procedure, we present a tool that allows business processes, specified as Petri nets, to be verified against their declarative process families using the NuSMV2 model checker. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - State-sponsored business advisory services face pressure to demonstrate value-added effects among their assisted enterprises. We employ a unique survey to measure the effectiveness of a business advisory program in promoting innovation in small businesses in Chile during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also seek to determine the role of innovation in mitigating the negative effects of the pandemic on enterprises’ closure, sales, and job creation. We observe a large likelihood of innovation and a lower likelihood of closure by assisted enterprises. We also find a reduction in sales and employment during the pandemic. However, these negative effects are mitigated in enterprises that implemented innovations such as online sales, delivery, commercialization through internet channels, and the creation of new products and/or services during the pandemic. The effects of the pandemic and induced innovation are more pronounced in family businesses than in non-family businesses. This finding suggests small family firms are both more vulnerable to crises but benefit more from crises-induced innovation. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In the era of VUCA, research on the impact of second-generation involvement on family business value has attracted much attention, there is a lack of related discussion. Based on a sample of 514 Chinese listed family companies from 2018 to 2022, this study shows that second-generation involvement is positively correlated with firm value, and ESG performance plays a moderating role in this relationship. Notably, the impact of second-generation involvement is more pronounced in enterprises operating in highly competitive industries. The paper offers countermeasures for family enterprises to optimize second-generation involvement and ESG performance, and eventually enhance firm value and promote the sustainable development. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the motives and the business model canvas adopted by urban poor women to set up microenterprises in the informal sector. Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative analysis used in the paper is based on empirical findings from field work conducted in Mumbai and Pune district in the state of Maharashtra situation on the western coast of the Indian sub-continent. In total, 63 women microentrepreneurs were interviewed using an interview guide, which contained open-ended questions regarding choices made to become an entrepreneur, business canvas mechanics, family and community support to start and manage their businesses. The paper presents findings across the sample and two selected case studies. Findings: In contrast to the view that women’s informal sector micro entrepreneurship is a result of “involuntary exclusion” or “poverty”, this paper found that women’s motives are a result of a wide variety of factors including supplementing family income, gain social recognition and a variety of other reasons. The business canvas of the entrepreneurs focussed on key partners, resource planning, customer orientation and sales promotion. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of the study is that it focussed on women micro entrepreneurs in the urban informal sector in Mumbai and Pune. Similar studies can be carried out in other mega-metro cities with a large urban poor population in India. Social implications: Venturing in the microenterprise sector is an important way for employment generation amongst women from the low-income groups in the urban informal sector. Women are becoming important players in the microenterprise sector and have tremendous relevance in India as the contribution of this sector to the Indian economy is significant. Originality/value: There are very few studies in the Indian context, which focus upon the business canvas of women micro entrepreneurs in the urban informal sector. This study, therefore, presents new knowledge around women’s micro entrepreneurship in India. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Driven by profit, the excessive enthusiasm of family enterprises for financial asset investment is bound to affect sustainable green innovation investment. In order to curb the excessive expansion of family business financialization and guide finance to return to serving the essence of the real economy, we analyzed the impact of family business financialization on green innovation from the perspective of family operations. In this study, we selected 4,108 family enterprises in China from 2008 to 2023 to establish OLS models and structural equation models (SEM) comprehensively, obtaining main conclusions: The financialization of family businesses suppressed green innovation by decreasing the level of risk-taking. Family control weakened the negative relationship between risk-taking and green innovation, while family management strengthened this relationship. When the generation of controllers and managers were one, the moderating effect of family control on risk-taking and green innovation was more significant. Therefore, this paper proposes suggestions from four aspects: moderately allocating family members, enhancing the risk management level of family businesses, consolidating family control rights, and improving the inheritability of social capital, in order to ultimately achieve stable intergenerational inheritance and sustainable operation of family businesses. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Entrepreneurial ecosystems have become a popular concept within research and practitioner contexts. Yet, while both literature streams have produced relevant eco-factors, no clear empirical evidence has emerged on their impact. This study addresses the following question: in impoverished areas, to what extent does the business ecosystem reduce gender differences in entrepreneurial success (controlling ownership and business longevity)? Our framework distinguishes three levels—cultural, social, and material—in the four major regions of the Indian ecosystem. Our results show that family support is most important in reducing the gender gap in the success of entrepreneurs. We establish the importance of social network support. We find no evidence that capital funding influences the gender gap in entrepreneurial success. Last, our study suggests that the more female entrepreneurs are exposed to local markets at the beginning of their enterprise, the more entrepreneurially successful they are than male entrepreneurs. Implications are discussed. © 2022

Design/methodology/approach: Using mixed methods, the study involved three phases of data collection and data analysis: (1) delphi survey, (2) online survey, (3) proposition of principles and validation interviews. Findings: The key principles identified by the present research are (1) develop product-oriented business model, (2) promote leadership and mindset engagement with OSC principles, (3) engage in partnerships and more innovative contractual models, (4) shift toward digital transformation, (5) develop training and knowledge management strategies, (6) adopt lean construction (LC) practices, (7) develop training and knowledge management strategies and (8) integrate logistics and supply chain management with AEC (architecture, engineering and construction) processes. Practical implications: The implementation of the principles and strategic changes identified in this study aims to prepare design and construction companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to embrace the increasing use of OSC in multifamily projects in the USA, which will make them more efficient and resilient and, ultimately, will contribute to the construction of more affordable and sustainable multifamily housing projects in the USA. Originality/value: This is the first research to address holistic strategies to support design and construction companies in adopting OSC. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: In many countries, small and medium-sizes enterprises (SMEs) are primarily responsible for wealth, economic growth, innovation and research and development. In this paper, the authors examine the impact of family ownership and owner involvement on the financial performance of unlisted Finnish SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: This is an empirical paper using a random sample of 1,137 non-listed Finnish SMEs. Through regression analyses and robustness tests, the authors examine the effects of family management, family and employee ownership and involvement. Findings: Using profitability measures, the authors find family-owned and controlled SMEs perform significantly better than non-family firms. The number of family members actively involved in daily business operations bears a significant negative relation to firm performance. In contrast, non-family firms in which owners are actively involved, provide comparable returns to family firms, suggesting that in non-family firms active involvement contributes to performance. The authors find that employee ownership in SMEs does not provide an efficient way to compensate employees since more dispersed ownership does not lead to higher performance. Research limitations/implications: SME employee ownership does not provide an efficient way to compensate employees since more dispersed ownership does not lead to higher performance. Practical implications: In the case of Finland, family ownership is an effective organisational structure. As the depth of the COVID pandemic remains uncertain, firms with committed ownership are key to the economic recovery. Originality/value: The authors approach the family ownership and involvement issue from a different angle. Unlike earlier studies, the authors examine the impact of both family ownership and involvement on the financial performance of privately owned SMEs. This paper helps shed light on the role of family ownership and involvement as a possible explanatory factor of overall economic performance. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Family businesses require internal communication (IC) to guide and provide direction, and the unique nature of involving both family and nonfamily employees add complexity. Navigating this complexity helps to ensure effective direction and management of family businesses. This paper explores the existing research concerning IC within family businesses and discusses the lenses and contexts through which it is commonly studied. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a concise literature review to identify the most common lenses through which IC in family business has been researched. Findings: IC in family enterprises is mostly studied through the lenses of IC between family generations, IC and the influence on family identity, and IC in times of crises. Existing research is largely focused on the role of family in IC, and limited consideration is given to the role of nonfamily members and family members outside of the business. Originality/value: The paper synthesizes the direction and findings of existing research into IC within family business and provides avenues for future research. Managerial implications are also presented based on the synthesis of existing literature. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study is about women entrepreneurs engaged in micro enterprises, their socio-demographic characteristics, their challenges and the factors motivating them to start a business in an urban setting in India. With the intention of attaining deep insights into the current conditions, motives and challenges of Indian urban women in entrepreneurship, a survey of 284 women entrepreneurs running micro enterprises in various areas of service sector like education, (e.g., play schools and coaching centres), beauty care and treatment (beauty parlours/salons), tailoring boutiques, day care centres (crèches) and retail trade (retail shop), etc., was conducted. The respondents were asked about their family structure, capital invested and factors that motivated them to start business. The results revealed the economic, social and personal factors that motivated them to start a business enterprise.  © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to trace the evolution of paternalism as a long-term component of a management control system (MCS) in a multi-national business enterprise. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a historical methodology involving the collection and evaluation of both primary and secondary data. Annual reports of Michelin (2009–2021) were also analysed to trace the evolution of the MCS towards corporate social responsibility (CSR). Findings: This research traces the evolution of Michelin's Paternalistic MCS from “Traditional Paternalism” to “Welfare Paternalism”, “Managerial Paternalism” and “Libertarian Paternalism” thereby leading the way to CSR. The findings indicate that the evolution of the MCS revealed “Managerial Paternalism” as a specific type of paternalism and an important component of the “Personnel and Cultural Controls” (Merchant and Van der Stede, 2018, p. 95) at Michelin. Research limitations/implications: Many multi-national companies began as family-owned and controlled firms (e.g. Ford, Toyota, Fiat, Renault, Tata) and they often employed paternalistic MCSs during their early development (Newby, 1977; Perrot, 1979; Colli, 2003). Such MCSs have been seen as being anachronistic and are often abandoned as the family-owned enterprise grows into a multi-national company (Casson and Cox, 1993; McKinlay et al., 2010). The research challenges this assertion and demonstrates how aspects of a paternalistic MCS can survive in a multi-national business enterprise. Practical implications: With respect to practical implications, this research shows that paternalism can still be a component of an MCS in a multi-national enterprise. Originality/value: Using a historical approach, this research addresses a gap in the prior literature regarding the variations and persistence of paternalism in companies. In the case of Michelin, the authors investigate the evolution of its paternalistic MCS from a traditional form to an emphasis on CSR. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The marginalisation of female entrepreneurs in accessing credit is well documented. Yet, how female entrepreneurs navigate through the marginalisation to gain funding is under-explored. Design/methodology/approach: The authors address this gap using qualitative data from 30 female entrepreneurs in three neighbourhoods with varying socio-economic characteristics in Ghana's capital, Accra. Findings: The authors find a marked aversion to bank loans among respondents. Consequently, they nurtured trust in their social circles in order to facilitate access to informal credit from internal (e.g. family and friends) and external (e.g. trade credit, associations and religious organisations) sources. This aversion to loans from formal financial institutions (FFIs) had a socio-cultural aspect, including cumbersome application procedures, a deep-rooted fear of the social consequences of defaulting and religious prohibition against interest payment for Islamic traders. Social implications: This paper shows that providing formal access to credit is not enough to support women's entrepreneurship if the socio-cultural factors inhibiting women's access to credit from FFIs are not addressed. Originality/value: The findings suggest that trust is an important factor that bridges the gap in female entrepreneurs' access to funding given their heavy reliance on informal sources of funding.

AB  - Family businesses are increasingly recognized for their significance in the global economy, constituting a growing portion of companies worldwide and elevating the importance of this topic on governmental agendas. Unique challenges confront family firms, intertwining business decisions with familial repercussions. Among these challenges, the succession process emerges as a critical threat to their continuity. Inadequate solutions to the question of succession often lead to organizational failure, underscoring the urgency of addressing this issue. This study endeavors to construct an analysis model to support decision-makers throughout the succession journey, integrating a constructivist approach that merges cognitive mapping and interpretive structural modeling (ISM). This dual methodology facilitates the swift identification and analysis of factors crucial for smoother family business succession. The model development leverages insights from an expert panel and entails delineating cause-and-effect relationships among identified determinants and prioritizing these factors based on their significance. Subsequently, the model undergoes validation through a consolidation session with experts from the Associação de Empresas Familiares (i.e., Family Business Association in Portuguese), who assess its practical applicability. This includes perspectives from a Brazilian expert renowned for his understanding of family business dynamics within an emerging economy—Brazil. The insights gleaned from these sessions inform recommendations on implementing the tested procedures within real-life family enterprises, thereby contributing to the sustainability and longevity of these businesses. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Rare disasters have had a significant impact on China′s economic development, particularly affecting the survival and growth of small and microenterprises. Compared with large and medium-sized enterprises, small and microenterprises face a more serious problem of difficult and expensive financing. This paper studies the decline in residents′ willingness to resume work and the risk of business shutdown caused by rare disaster impacts on economic development, as well as the heterogeneity between small and medium-sized enterprises and large and medium-sized enterprises. In the first part, we present three key facts about the risks of rare disasters and their impact on small and micro-enterprises, based on a literature review and summary. First, the impact of rare disaster risks on economic development lasts for a long time and affects a wide range of factors. It is necessary for the government to intervene with appropriate fiscal and monetary policies. Second, China′s small and microenterprises receive less credit support from the financial system, and the phenomenon of financing constraints is very serious. Third, Rare disasters, especially pandemics, have a significant negative impact on capital utilization rates and employees′ willingness to return to work. In the second part, we construct a DSGE model including large and medium enterprises and small and microenterprises. The basic structure of the model includes the following: households obtain income through wages, interest in deposits and transfer payments to purchase retail goods; labor unions are responsible for packaging and providing wage-sticky labor provided by families to production enterprises; large and medium-sized enterprises and small and microenterprises utilize capital and labor to produce two types of intermediate goods; small and microenterprises face Kiyotaki and Moore type financing constraints; monopolistic competitive retailers package intermediate goods produced by large and medium enterprises and small and microenterprises to generate retail goods; and the central bank implements monetary policy through the extended Taylor rule. Assuming that the probability of disasters has a certain continuity, the impact on the operating rate of enterprises and the willingness to supply labor of residents occurs simultaneously with the onset of the disaster, and the impact of disaster follows a logarithmic first-order autoregressive process. In the third part, the parameters of the model are calibrated and Bayesian estimated. The fixed parameters in the model are mainly obtained by referring to the research results in the literature and combined with the actual situation of China. The dynamic parameters in the model are obtained by Bayesian estimation based on the quarterly data of China′s economy from the second quarter of 2004 to the fourth quarter of 2018. The estimated value, significance interval, acceptance rate, MCMC convergence diagnostics and prior and posterior distributions of Bayesian estimation all show that the estimated parameter values are robust. In the fourth part, we simulate and analyze the effect of the impact of rare disasters on the real economy and compare the heterogenous behaviors of small and microenterprises and large and medium-sized enterprises under different financing constraints and degrees of impact of the pandemic. The simulation analysis results show that in the absence of policy intervention, rare disasters lead to a decrease in total investment, an increase in unemployment, and an increase in inflation, which places greater downward pressure on the economy. Compared with large and medium-sized enterprises, small and microenterprises with financing constraints are more negatively affected by the impact of the pandemic. Starting from alleviating the financing constraints of small and microenterprises and implementing loose monetary policy, this paper discusses the effect of rescue measures with different intensities on promoting economic recovery. The weakening of the financing constraints of small and microenterprises can increase the total social investment and employment. Loose monetary policy helps hedge against the negative effects of rare disasters in the short term but does not have a long-term growth effect. In summary, the long-standing financing constraints of small and microenterprises make such enterprises face greater risk after the rare disaster shock. After the shock, without government intervention and support policies, more employment and credit resources flow to large and medium-sized enterprises. This further squeezes the development space of small and microenterprises and has a more adverse impact on economic recovery and long-term development. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent for state and local governments to increase support for small and microenterprises. © (2023), (Zhejiang University). All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This article explores the role of stewardship practices related to entrepreneurial leadership in turning entrepreneurial orientation (EO) into family firm performance while considering its environmental context. Family business research has not fully investigated how the EO–financial performance relationship depends on configurations of internal and external factors which establish strategic fit. We argue that family firms can overcome the often-highlighted paternalism-entrepreneurship paradox by employing stewardship practices related to entrepreneurial leadership (internal factor), which in turn can help them leverage strategic fit between EO and dynamic environments (external factor). The results of a survey of 162 Austrian small and medium-sized family enterprises (family SMEs) show that family SMEs can only profit from EO under certain configurations of internal and external factors. Employing stewardship practices related to entrepreneurial leadership turns out to be an efficient and necessary condition for transforming EO into performance. Environmental dynamism is, furthermore, a double-edged sword facilitating and impeding the transformation of EO into performance. These findings contribute to existing research by shedding light on the role of stewardship practices in establishing strategic fit in entrepreneurial family firms. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Research methodology: The case study is based on field data including semi-structured interviews with the main protagonist and related stakeholders of Karan Handicraft, a leather craft artisan enterprise. After informed consent, the interviews with the craft artisan entrepreneurs of Karan Handicraft were conducted, transcribed and analysed verbatim in the respondents’ native language, Kutchi Gujarati. The authors also used archival data given by the company. In addition, secondary data from industry reports and business magazines was used to create the case. Case overview/synopsis: The case investigates the impact of digital technologies on the small handicraft artisan entrepreneurs by focusing on a family-run business of a leather craft. It traces the evolution of Karan Handicraft, based in Kutch district of Gujarat, India from the year 2007 to 2023. The third-generation artisan entrepreneur Karan Marvada attempted exploring the new-age social media platforms to showcase the products, modified his product designs to attract a new customer-base and adapted to digital marketing. However, in the wake of the crowding in the handicraft cluster, the central business problem that Karan was grappling with was, if he should scale up his artisanal entrepreneurial stint using electronic commerce (e-commerce) as a medium. Another allied issue is in such a scale-up, should he use e-commerce, i.e. as a medium of communication only or as a medium of both communication and delivery. While the latter may lead to scale, it may raise the challenge of not being able to preserve the traditional values of his ancestral business. Complexity academic level: This case involves various issues that arise in entrepreneurship management, such as decisions related to growth strategy (remain small and unique vs become large and mass scale), to maintain a physical presence vs digital presence and the form of digital presence, are dwelt upon. The case is aimed at graduate students in an entrepreneurship or family business course. It could also be taught in other courses that focus on innovation and social entrepreneurship. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Research methodology: This case is based on primary and secondary data collection. ABCo’s Founder, Jocelyn Sheppard, sat down with the author for a 75-min recorded interview in July 2022, and she provided follow-up information via email. Interview data was supplemented with secondary data from publicly available sources to fill in portions on the founder, the company’s history and its location; and triangulate the collected interview data (Creswell and Poth, 2018). There are no conflicts of interest that the author needs to disclose related to the founder or company. The case was piloted at one institution in the Fall 2022, Spring 2023 and Fall 2023 semesters, with 59 undergraduates in an in-person social entrepreneurship course and 165 undergraduates and 33 graduate students in an online asynchronous social entrepreneurship course. All students worked through the case in groups, and as a requirement of their corresponding assignment submission, they provided feedback that was de-identified. In total, 60 groups reported their feedback, which was considered during the subsequent drafts of the case and instructors’ manual IM. According to the anonymized feedback, the protagonist, product line, desired social impact and experienced challenges of ABCo were all said to be interesting, approachable and relatable for students, and the case piqued the interest of students coming from different majors (e.g. business, environmental issues, human services and criminal justice). Students from rural areas, or those who have family in rural areas, felt the case was particularly interesting; a handful of the students in the asynchronous online class who were unfamiliar with such settings suggested providing students with some additional contextualization of rural environments, either through class discussion with other students who had experience in those environments or additional media or text-based supports. Further adjustments also included removing a reading and a corresponding question and revising elements within the Teaching Approaches section of the IM to support the additions they suggested within the feedback (i.e. spending time to define and walk through the provided model and highlight the differences of rural entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship in the rural as a class before engaging in the related write-ups for that question). Case overview/synopsis: Jocelyn Sheppard, Founder of Appalachian Botanical Company (“ABCo”), had built her company not just on a vision of revitalizing reclaimed coal mine land through planting and producing products with lavender, but also to have a social impact on the rural town of Ashford and its greater region of Boone County in West Virginia, USA. While she understood that hiring workers in need of a second chance would present its challenges, she was shocked by the depth of social need her new employees presented, which contributed to many employees’ disruptive behaviors and turnover. To approach the problem at hand, Sheppard needed to reflect on the resources around her, namely, other entities and organizations who might be able to support her efforts to improve how ABCo delivers on its social mission and, thus, helps to improve the local community and its economy. The case draws upon literature and models within rural entrepreneurship and community development to have students advise Sheppard on what she should do next to improve the social outcomes for ABCo and its employees. Complexity academic level: This case is geared for both upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses in entrepreneurship, including in social, environmental and rural entrepreneurship courses and course modules. The case introduces students to a social enterprise struggling to get its footing in a rural context. The case would be suitable for both introductory and advanced courses, especially when placemaking/place-based entrepreneurship or ecosystem building are discussed. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This paper investigates the impact of family influence measured by the F-PEC scale on private enterprise (both family firms and lone founders) leadership succession strategy. Design/methodology/approach: The research dataset is comprised of 390 private enterprises whose head offices were situated in the voivodeships of Lower Silesia and Wielkopolska in Poland. The authors collected data through CAPI (computer-assisted personal interviewing) method, as well as through comprehensive, structured interviews with company owners. Data were analysed using hierarchical logistic regression for each type of succession strategy. Findings: The results suggest that increased family influence does not necessarily lead to intra-family leadership succession in private enterprises. Importantly, a range of findings contradicted authors' predictions. The relationship between the overall F-PEC scale values signifying the multi-faceted family influence over the business and the choice of internal successor was weakly negative for the total sample; also, the higher the overlap between family and business values and the higher the commitment to family business, as evidenced by the Culture subscale, the lower was the occurrence of intra-family successor choice in the population of lone founders. The Culture subscale also increased the prevalence of lack of succession planning in the sample of lone founders. Originality/value: While several studies suggests that family firms may be more prone to choose an intra-family succession scenario, it remains unclear how lower levels of business and succession experience, may influence the successor choice. Indeed, some studies suggest that a strong family influence over a business, may stimulate family firms to choose a family outsider as a business leader. Therefore, the key contribution of this study is contextualizing the response to an ongoing succession debate. This study investigates the strategic choices of companies in the first generation of ownership operating in Poland, which serves as an example of a post-transition economy. While the characteristics of this economic environment may be unique, the authors discuss how the surprising findings may add to the understanding of the general succession processes present in private enterprises. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - By integrating literature on behavioral agency theory and fear as an emotional lens, we develop a theoretical framework explaining how family owners' fear of losing specific dimensions of socio-emotional endowments influence family firm innovativeness. Our analysis of data from a two-phased, multi-respondent, matched survey (n = 407) at two different time points from family SMEs (n = 207) in manufacturing industries in Chongqing, China, shows that socio-emotional preferences, and the fear attached to losing specific endowments, activate or constrain innovativeness. Family owners' fear of losing family control and influence increases firm innovativeness, as do family owners' fear of losing guanxi (social bonds). However, family owners' fear of losing identification with the business among family members decreases firm innovativeness, as do family owners' fear of being unable to renew family bonds. By deepening current understanding of fear and the perceived danger of losing socio-emotional wealth as determinants of firm innovativeness, our findings offer important implications for theory and practice, correcting for the inattention to sentiments and emotional preferences family owners may or may not have towards specific socio-emotional dimensions in their strategic choices. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the study is to examine the effects of opportunity creation and discovery on the performance of family firms. Specifically, from the tenets of dynamic capabilities and organizational contingency perspectives, this study proposes and tests a framework of how family firms' creation and discovery behavior impact venture growth and the conditions under which such impact can vary. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses moderated-hierarchical regression to analyze survey data from 156 family-owned small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating within a sub-Saharan African economy. Findings: The findings indicate that creation behavior has a curvilinear U-shaped relationship with venture growth, while discovery behavior has a direct positive relationship with venture growth. Further analysis reveals that the curvilinearity of the U-shaped relationship between creation and venture growth will be stronger for older family firms than for younger ones. Research limitations/implications: The study findings may be limited by the cross-sectional nature of the data and the specific focus on family firms only. Practical implications: The results highlight the significance of pursuing both opportunities among family firms. In fact, both creation and discovery opportunities are significant drivers of family firm growth, albeit in different capacities. Relatedly, managers of older family firms (compared to younger firms) can invest more in exploiting creative opportunities. Social implications: From these findings, governments and other stakeholders should create enabling environment and institutional frameworks conducive to exploiting opportunities by entrepreneurial firms. Originality/value: The study is novel – as it provides unique findings on the performance implications of creation and discovery behavior of entrepreneurial family firms within developing economies. © 2022, Francis Donbesuur, Magnus Hultman, Nathaniel Boso and Pejvak Oghazi.

AB  - “Openness” has become an established norm in the contemporary business environment. However, despite the crucial importance of boundaries and boundary work in organization and management theory, openness—as opening up boundaries of family firms and entrepreneurial families in collaborating with external actors—has received only nascent attention in the family business domain. We introduce the notion of openness in the family business field. Drawing on the organizational boundary and family business literatures, we develop a conceptual framework of family firm openness as boundary work and examine and discuss the drivers, mechanisms, and consequences of openness in family enterprises. Then, drawing on this framework, we set out an agenda for future research that will contribute to a better understanding of openness, boundaries, and boundary work in family firms and entrepreneurial families. We conclude by discussing some contemporary examples of research on the “open family firm.” © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Family businesses are enterprises characterized by a specific, broad set of goals of family and business nature, which can be in conflict with each other. The purpose of this article is to examine the impact of selected ownership-related factors on the process of setting the goals of family businesses, and more specifically, on the choice between alternative family and business goals. The data necessary for the analysis was collected through surveys of 300 family businesses managers. The hypotheses were verified using the non-parametric chi-square test. The analyses carried out showed that, of the determinants studied, the family’s share in the ownership of the business (whether family members are the only owners or whether there is a non-family partner in the company) is the greatest importance, while the number of family owners (one vs. at least two) does not significantly affect the choice between goals. This article makes an important contribution to research on family business, as it shows the role of family ownership factors in the process of choosing between alternative family and business goals. Such an approach is not very popular in the literature on the subject, but it is a valuable addition to existing approaches. © 2024, Czestochowa University of Technology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This paper examines the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) within family businesses, focusing on how AI can enhance their competitiveness, resilience and sustainability. The study seeks to provide insights into AI’s application in family business contexts, addressing the unique strengths and challenges these businesses face. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize existing research on the adoption and integration of AI in family businesses. The review involved a comprehensive analysis of relevant academic literature to identify key trends, opportunities, challenges and factors influencing AI adoption in family-owned enterprises. Findings: The review highlights the significant potential of AI for family businesses, particularly in improving operations, decision-making and customer engagement. It identifies opportunities such as analysing customer data, enhancing brand building, streamlining operations and improving customer experiences through technologies like Generative AI, Machine Learning, AI Chatbots and NLP. However, challenges like resource constraints, inadequate infrastructure, low customization and AI knowledge gaps inhibit AI adoption in family firms. The study proposes an AI adoption roadmap tailored for family businesses and outlines future research directions based on emerging themes in AI use within these enterprises. Originality/value: This paper addresses the underexplored area of AI integration in family businesses, contributing to the academic understanding of the intersection between AI and family-owned enterprises. The study offers a comprehensive synthesis of existing research, providing valuable insights and practical recommendations for enhancing the competitiveness and sustainability of family businesses through AI adoption. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Based on the trade-off theory of capital structure and the information asymmetry theory of business financing, we evaluated the association of informal financing with the financial performance of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the restaurant industry. This study collected survey responses directly from small- and medium-sized restaurant owners (n = 178) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of the study suggested that reliance on “family, friends, relatives, and third-party lenders” for financing was associated with lower financial performance during a crisis for restaurants. Results were robust when controlled for the owner’s gender, business affiliation, firm age, and relative firm size. Furthermore, we also found that the relative firm size of SMEs moderated this relationship such that, for mid-sized firms ($2–5 million annual revenues), the negative association with financial performance was lower than that for smaller firms (<$2 million annual revenue) and larger firms (>$5 million annual revenues). This article theoretically contributes to the literature by investigating the influence of informal financing on a firm’s performance, and the role of relative firm size within the category of SMEs in this relationship. Findings from the study provide practical guidance for SMEs and informal lenders. © The Author(s) 2023.

The research finds that there may be an optimal balance effect between family ownership and corporate governance in the process of achieving high-quality development for an enterprise; the business environment weakens the role of family ownership in the high-quality development of the enterprise. This further shows that the key to achieving high-quality development of family enterprises is coordinating multiple objectives, which provides insights for further exploration of development in the post-pandemic era. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to contribute to the academic disciplines of entrepreneurship and management by developing a new theory that explains Founder-CEOs’ succession in family and non-family firms. Many scholars failed to generate a specific theory to describe the succession of Founder-CEOs. Family firms remain complex enterprises comprising interconnectedness of cultural interests in which corporate governance occurs by families, Founder-CEOs and sometimes a board of directors. Design/methodology/approach: This study’s design/methodology/approach reflects post-modernist epistemological and ontological perspectives for conducting systematic literature reviews. To identify relevant studies in the review, the several databases (Australian Business Dean’s Council Journal Quality List; EBSCO Database, including PsycINFO and Psych studies; Web of Science) and a mix of ranked journals from entrepreneurship, management and psychology were used. Findings: The findings and results in this paper reflect the purpose, methodology and literature analysis culminating in 1,582 peer-reviewed studies. A total of 182 peer-reviewed studies met the criterion for review. Throughout the research process, a systematic literature review uncovered management literature gaps overlooked for decades during the theory-building process. Hence, developing a theory of Founder-CEOs succession used a combination of systematic, inductive, comparative and interactive approaches. Originality/value: A Theory of Founder-CEOs Succession explains the strategic process of replacing a founder systematically. The promotion of, and incentives for, internal executives have been topics of great interest and deliberation among scholars and practitioners for a long time. This study contributes research implications for theory building in the academic disciplines of entrepreneurship and management by offering scholars and practitioners a theory that does not exist to describe Founder-CEOs’ succession encompassing both strategic successes and failures. By incorporating successes and failures, this study provides realistic reflections of Founder-CEOs. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The importance of millet in the present ecosystem as a mitigating tool towards planet, people and business is realised across all stakeholders in the agriculture and agribusiness system. Farmer Producers Companies are the new economic enterprises evolved to strengthen the collective efforts of marginal and small farmers. Sustainability is an important pillar in the integration and transformation of millet based enterprises to a sustainable business unit among the farmers group in the farmer producers company. Considering the emerging importance of millets to the present climate stress situation and evolution of Farmer Producers Company, the present study was conducted in the western undulating zone of Odisha state, i.e., Kalahandi. The study is based on survey data brought out of a structured interview schedule. A total of 312 sample households were interviewed among four FPCs in different blocks of the district. Following two important research questions were raised to qualify the subject of the study: What are the factors responsible to undertake millet based enterprises among the farmers within the context of the study? What are the important sustainability factors that determine an impact on farmer income? The study found that value addition and innovations are the important sustainability factors that create an impact on farmer income. Collaboration was also found significant but not to the extent. Further age, marital status, family support, financial stability, scale of operations were the internal factors and policy governance and public relations as external factors that drives farmers’ decision to undertake millet based enterprises among the FPCs. The Odisha Millet Mission initiative has set to be a driving force across the production and post-production activities to strengthen and enhance the eco-environmental sustainability. © 2023 Indian Society of Agricultural Economics.

AB  - Purpose: In the modern digital age technologies like Industry 4.0 has revolutionized the manufacturing sector. There are many economic and technological advantages of digitalization. Along with economic benefits, manufacturing enterprises especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) need to take advantage of digitalization in strengthening their social performance. Observing the importance of social performance of Indian SMEs and availability of limited research in this direction, the current study has done a holistic analysis of social performance enablers. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review with a series of personal interviews of experts has been conducted to identify the enablers of social performance and supportive digital technologies. A fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) approach has been applied to find the degree of influence and interrelation between enablers. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to validate the results obtained. Findings: Authors observed that policies of corporate and social responsibility, support by top management, awareness of social performance issues, and ethical practices and collaboration amongst supply chain members are leading causing enablers of social performance. Preparedness for the uncertainty of pandemics, improved work conditions and ergonomics, green practices, improvement in global business and improved living standards of employees and their families are leading the effect group of enablers. Further authors also observed that social media, information and communication technologies (ICT), websites, smart surveillance, e-mails and cloud computing are few supportive digital technologies of social performance issues. Research limitations/implications: SMEs all over the globe are passing through a transition due to digitalization and influence of pandemics. The finding of current study highlights the importance of strategic management of social performance enablers. Since the research is very limited in the social performance area, especially in Indian SMEs, this study makes a notable contribution to the literature too. Originality/value: Novelty of this study is that social performance enablers of Indian SMEs in the digital era have been analysed holistically. The content of this research is the original work of the authors and has not been submitted for any other publication. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Family-owned businesses differ in their strategic intent and behavior as they serve as a reservoir of wealth and social status for their family owners. Family-owned businesses demonstrate relatively conservative strategic decision making that aspires long-term wealth preservation and enhancement. For family owners, investments in information technology (IT) raise a predicament as they are risky, yet a long-term imperative. We propose three hypotheses that build upon the thesis that family owners combine a deep understanding of the business with a strong influence on stakeholders within and beyond the firm’s boundaries to exert strategic control in the extended enterprise. First, family ownership negatively influences IT investment, because family owners are likely to avoid investments in IT that are frivolous, reduce information asymmetry, or leave auditable digital trails. Second, the negative influence of family ownership on IT investment is weakened when a career professional is appointed in the senior-most executive position of a family-owned business. This is because professional executives strive to utilize IT for control and performance benefits, and family owners desire to use IT to monitor and control the non-family professional executive. Third, family ownership weakens the negative influence of environmental hostility on the relationship between IT investment and firm performance, as family-owned businesses incur less dynamic adjustment costs and maintain better alignment between IT and business strategy. Empirical analysis, consisting of panel regression estimations, on archival data of publicly listed Indian firms in the years 2006 to 2018 provides support for our theory that highlights how IT for control acts as a noneconomic motivation for the strategic IT behavior of firms. In doing so, we bring family ownership into the theoretical foreground for future IS scholarship. We contribute to theory and practice by advancing the nature of ownership and executive management as sources of heterogeneity in IT investment and its business value. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper presents novel pathways for Information Systems (IS) research within the context of family business. As these enterprises navigate the impacts of digital transformation, understanding the intersection of IS and familial commerce has become imperative. Specifically, we address the following questions: (1) What are the key intersections between IS research questions and the nuanced context of family businesses? (2) How can IS researchers contribute to the understanding and advancement of family businesses within the context of India, and in GREAT (Growing, Rural, Eastern, Aspirational, and Transitional) economies more broadly? Our extensive literature review showcases emerging trends in family business research and lessons from history and practice that are valuable for family firms in GREAT nations such as India. We also review existing IS research on issues centered around the family business context. Underscoring unexplored research inquiries that resonate with insights from Indian business history, we advocate for further research at the crossroads of IS and family business, acknowledging the existing scarcity of scholarly contributions within this domain. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Like most organizations, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) generates a lot of data of varying types, from clinical to staffing and operations. However, these datasets are separated, preventing effective analytics. To improve workforce management and care delivery, CHOP's Nursing department collaborated with the Data & Analytics team to create a dashboard-based platform for analyzing workforce metrics and patient outcomes, aiding nursing leaders in decision-making. This project involved multiple phases with contributions from Nursing, Data & Analytics, CHOP's Data Trust Office, and Human Resources. Key performance indicators were identified, and a variety of data sources were aggregated to provide a comprehensive view of the nursing enterprise. The resulting platform offers automated, current, and reliable analytics on various aspects, including nursing demographics, education, survey results, staffing actuals by job group, and patient and family experience data. The platform's usability was assessed using a modified Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Scale survey, with a 29% response rate primarily from senior directors and managers. The findings showed high usability and satisfaction, indicating the dashboard is a valuable decision-support tool. Lessons learned include the need for analytics education for nurses and mid-managers, the inclusion of critical nursing-specific metrics (and development of the data pipelines making them possible), and the integration of multidisciplinary team metrics for comprehensive nursing analytics.  © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - The current chapter discusses important characteristics of the family business in Kuwait by looking into the links between entrepreneurship, small and medium-sized enterprises, family businesses, and their growth over the years. The authors start by giving a general overview of Kuwait's business ecosystem, which served as a predominant external factor for the development of successful family businesses. One of the key factors in family business development in Kuwait was the country’s economic growth after the oil discovery. This growth drove many family businesses. Besides this, the tribal and family linkages were identified as an important driving force. Lastly, the chapter identifies the most successful family businesses in Kuwait and tries to assert the major common characteristics of these companies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - We study the impact characteristics of a CEO have when small and medium enterprises (SMEs) look for partners to form strategic alliances. Such bilateral information-sharing partnerships are advantageous because they enable the incorporation of outside expertise. As most SMEs are either entrepreneur-driven or revolve around family businesses, the role of CEOs as leaders becomes important during partner selection. This study attempts to increase our understanding of the “human” role played by SME during the adoption of new partners. We add to existing information by demonstrating that partner leader characteristics must be considered when analyzing partner selection in a SME. In the context of SMEs, the study proposes a conceptualization by creating a framework that connects SME CEOs with partner selection. We have used the PRISMA model to conduct a literature review and propose the framework to integrate characteristics and partner selection in the context of the SMEs. The selection of papers has been from ABDC listed A* and A category journals published in the past three years. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023.

AB  - The escalating demands from legislative authorities and stakeholders for companies to adopt corporate sustainability measures underscore the growing importance of strategic sustainability management. Despite the efforts made by companies in this domain, the strategic management of sustainability in family businesses remains an under-researched area. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review covering the period from 2006 to 2022, on the topic of strategic sustainability management in family businesses. Our investigation encompasses a content analysis of 98 relevant studies. Our research question is: “What aspects are taken into account by family businesses in their corporate sustainability strategies?” We tackle this issue through a methodological triangulation of qualitative and quantitative methods. Our results yield three clusters of strategies for corporate sustainability in family businesses: (1) Family values and succession planning; Stakeholder relations and communication; (2) Risk taking, Inventions, and Technologies; and (3) Entrepreneurship and Intrapreneurship. In addition, we systematically present a range of descriptive indicators, including the research methodologies applied and the geographic focus of the published literature. This research contributes significant insights for scholars and practitioners alike, providing valuable guidance in this field. Moreover, our study paves the way for further investigations into the strategies that influence sustainability within the context of family businesses. By shedding light on this critical area, we aim to foster a more sustainable and informed approach to corporate practices among family-owned enterprises. © The Author(s) 2024.

The data was collected from the organization’s website, annual reports, press releases, published reports and documents available on the internet. Case overview/synopsis: According to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) World Energy Outlook (WEO), 775 million people worldwide would not have access to electricity even by 2022, with the majority of them living in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (Cozzi et al., 2022). In SSA, energy poverty had been a serious issue over the years. According to the IEA, 600 million people lacked access to electricity in 2019, while 900 million people cooked with traditional fuels (Cozzi et al., 2022). A World Bank report from 2018 said many SSA countries had energy access levels of less than 25% (Cozzi et al., 2022). Energy poverty in SSA hampered sustainable development and economic growth. Despite significant efforts to address this poverty, Africa remained the continent with the lowest energy density in the world. Although solar and other energy-saving products were appealing, their adoption rates were modest, and their distribution strategies were not particularly effective. The lack of electricity exacerbated a number of socioeconomic problems, as it increased the demand for and use of wood fuel, which caused serious health problems and environmental harm. While working in Uganda, Katherine Lucey (Lucey) saw that having no electricity had negatively affected women’s health in particular because it was women who were responsible for taking care of the home. These effects were both direct and indirect. The women’s reliance on potentially harmful fuels for cooking, such as firewood and charcoal, resulted in their suffering from respiratory and eye problems, in addition to other health issues. Furthermore, the distribution of energy-saving and renewable energy items was seen as the domain of men, and there was an inherent gender bias in energy decisions. Women were not encouraged to participate in energy decisions, despite the fact that they were the ones managing the home and would gain from doing so. In addition, because there was no light after dusk, people worked less efficiently. Lucey saw the economic and social difficulties that electricity poverty caused for women in rural Africa. She also witnessed how the lives of a few families and organizations changed after they started using solar products. This motivated her to start Solar Sister with the mission of achieving a sustainable, scalable impact model for expanding access to clean energy and creating economic opportunities for women. Solar Sister collaborated with local women and women-centric organizations to leverage the existing network. Women were trained, provided all the necessary support and encouraged to become Solar Sister Entrepreneurs and sell solar products in their communities and earn a commission on each sale. To provide clean energy at their customers’ doorstep, the Solar Sister Entrepreneurs received a “business in a bag” – a start-up kit containing inventory, training and marketing assistance. Solar Sister’s business model empowered the women in SSA by providing them with an entrepreneurship opportunity and financial independence. Also, the use of solar products helped them shift from using hazardous conventional cooking fuels and lead a healthy life. The children in their households were able to study after sunset, and people in the community became more productive with access to clean energy. The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, however, had a serious impact on Solar Sister. It found it challenging to mentor and encourage new business owners due to restrictions on travel and on group gatherings. The Solar Sisters were unable to do business outside the house either. Their source of income, which they relied on to support their families, was therefore impacted. The COVID-19 outbreak also slowed down the progress achieved by the community over the years and made household energy purchasing power worse. Furthermore, the organization was also grappling with other issues like limited access to capital, lack of awareness and infrastructural challenges. Another challenge lay in monitoring and evaluating the organization’s impact on the last mile. In the absence of standardized measurement tools and issues in determining the social impact of Solar Sister, it would be interesting to see what approach Lucey will take to measure the impact of Solar Sister on the society. What measurement tool/s will Lucey implement to gauge the social impact of Solar Sister?

AB  - We examine the role of Hidden Champions in rural areas in advancing regional digitalization through corporate local and regional responsibility and place leadership. Endowed with abundant internal resources and high innovative capacity, these global niche market leaders face regional resource constraints, concerning digital infrastructure and workforce with digital capabilities. 57 semi-structured interviews with firm representatives and regional actors in rural Germany are analyzed. We show that these enterprises strategically use measures of corporate local and regional responsibility and exert place leadership to develop digitalization-related assets in their rural regions. These initiatives are operated through modes of both inclusive and exclusive agency and benefit. We find that the motives for these actions are grounded in a perceived lack of swiftness and capacity of public actors, but also entail emotional attachment to the region, particularly for family businesses. Our findings have implications for regional policymakers, such as targeting greater alignment of regional and corporate development goals. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Abstract: Despite scholarly attention on family firm innovation, sources of heterogeneity in family firm innovation remain veiled. Drawing upon the mixed gamble perspective, this study introduces and examines a contingency that affects the level of family-owned firms’ innovativeness: inter-organizational cooperation. Based on the idea that inter-organizational cooperation affects family-owned firms’ mixed gamble on innovation, we hypothesize that inter-organizational cooperation mitigates the negative relationship between family ownership and firm’s innovativeness and that the moderating effect varies contingent on the types of cooperative partner and activity. The hypotheses are examined in a sample of 1211 small and medium enterprises in South Korea. The results offer insight into variation in family firm innovation. Our results show that inter-organizational cooperation, especially with non-commercial organizations, is associated with higher levels of innovation. Findings support the idea that family business owners cooperate with external partners as a way to mitigate potential SEW losses often associated with strategic risk. By using a sample of Korean SMEs, we respond to calls in family business research to examine contexts beyond Western countries. Additional contributions, limitations, and future research directions are also discussed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Since 2010, China's traditional industry has entered a critical stage of development and enterprise reform and development is imminent. Product homogenization is serious in this market, so that the competition among enterprises is fierce. At the same time, international brands continue to enter the Chinese consumption market, which intensifies the competition and seriously squeezes the market share of Chinese local brands. However, the popularization and development of the Internet and the change of people's consumption concept and level make the market put forward higher requirements for the development of business operation and many traditional family enterprises have embarked on the road of transformation. It is of great significance and value to clarify the influence of internal factors of family enterprises on strategic transformation. The performance evaluation of family business strategic transition is really a multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems. In this paper, the 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic number grey relational analysis (2TLNN-GRA) method is proposed along with on the traditional grey relational analysis (GRA) and 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic sets (2TLNNSs). Firstly, the 2TLNNSs is introduced. Then, combine the traditional fuzzy GRA model with 2TLNNSs information, the 2TLNN-GRA method is established and the computing steps for MAGDM are built. Finally, a numerical example for performance evaluation of family business strategic transition has been given and some comparisons is used to illustrate advantages of 2TLNN-GRA method. © 2023 - IOS Press.

AB  - While much has been written about Ebony, Essence, and other Black-oriented publications, little has been established on the Black family as depicted in the business-oriented publication Black Enterprise, which has been in operation for more than a half century. Tenets of sustainable family business theory are useful in understanding the ideas and innovations of Earl G. Graves Sr., who founded Black Enterprise magazine and transformed it into one of the nation’s top Black-owned and Black-operated media companies. This study focuses on twenty-eight of Graves’s Publisher’s Page columns printed between 1970 and 2015 that showcase the role of the Black family, particularly in the development of successful business enterprises. © 2023, University of Nebraska Press.

AB  - Learning outcomes: The learning outcomes are as follows: understanding the impact on company growth through identification and alignment of stakeholder priorities in a project for SME in an emerging market; analyzing the impact of stakeholder alignment and relationship management on the project outcome; and evaluating the importance of Stakeholder Management for effective Project Management. Case overview/synopsis: The case of ‘Hospedia Medicare,’ a medical device manufacturing company based in India, was started by a family involved in the medical devices business for over two decades. The company began operations in a new avatar and focused on one medical device or product by 2013. The product was designed with quality features to solve customer problems, making the cost relatively high compared to other domestic peers. Creating new product lines or updating the existing product attributes was imperative for the company to attain its growth objectives. The protagonist was dealing with a dilemma involving managing various stakeholders, aligning the project scope to create a growth story for the company in line with its vision and managing the stakeholders by understanding and analyzing their needs, expectations and interest, thus influencing the project outcome. The case can be used by instructors to identify, understand and evaluate the importance of different stakeholders on project outcome or success. Furthermore, it can be used to analyze and critique the impact of stakeholders on project scope, which can affect the long-term sustainability of the company, as different stakeholders have different expectations and needs. The case also details how regular communication, collaboration and awareness became essential for the project's success. Lack of an effective engagement strategy at the project planning stage can have risks concerning cost and achieving the overall vision, which creates a positive outcome for all the stakeholders. Complexity academic level: The case study can be introduced to graduate and undergraduate students to reflect on and critique the importance of Stakeholder Management in Project Management. It can be used for, entrepreneurship, project management, operations and strategy, particularly emphasizing for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

AB  - This study delves into the impact of personal traits on rural female entrepreneurship within family-owned enterprises. We investigate how rural female entrepreneurs strategically navigate their businesses, taking into account market conditions, technical aspects, financial considerations, operational challenges, organizational dynamics, and innovation factors. Employing a mixed-method approach, we collected quantitative data from 183 formal and informal rural female entrepreneurs using a semi-structured questionnaire available in both English and Arabic, utilizing snowball sampling. Through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), we identified strategic objectives, and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) assessed the alignment of the proposed approach with the data sample. Additionally, we present six brief case studies based on interviews with female entrepreneurs to gain insights into how personal traits influence strategic entrepreneurial behaviour. Our findings highlight the significant influence of age and education on the strategic goals, motivation, and decision-making of rural female entrepreneurs. This research has broader implications for policymakers and stakeholders, offering insights into encouraging inclusive and sustainable female entrepreneurship in diverse rural contexts. By recognizing the relationship of personal attributes and institutional forces, this study contributes to our understanding of entrepreneurship in a dynamic and culturally rich environment, ultimately contributing to socioeconomic development in Oman and beyond. © 2023, Small Business Institute.

AB  - For family enterprises, evergreen is their long-term goal of unremitting pursuit, and the development of technological innovation activities for family firms with the goal of evergreen is of great significance. Starting from three dimensions of family ownership participation, family management participation and family inheritance participation, this paper extracts data from China Stock Market & Accounting Research Database (CSMAR) database and Chinese Research Data Services Platform (CNRDS), using python for text extraction and analysis of financial statements, based on the data of 506 listed companies in China from 2015 to 2019 screened from tens of thousands of companies, this paper draws a conclusion that family participation will restrain the technological innovation of enterprises. At last, the article puts forward some suggestions, such as diluting equity, hiring external professional managers, and forming a good corporate culture, to alleviate the negative impact of family inheritance and promote the long-term development of enterprises.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The business baton in a nonfarm family is transferred from one generation to another, while in a farm family, this is not often the case. Most of the farmers do not wish their next generation taking up this baton from them. In addition, the next generation is not keen to hold this baton and move forward. One of the major reasons behind this is poor income from farming and allied activities. Long back in 1928, the report of Royal Commission on Agriculture mentioned, “The Indian peasant is born in debt, lives in debt and bequeaths the indebtedness to his successors.” And the change is very slow. Realizing the miseries of Indian farmers, the Indian Government called for doubling farmers’ income and set up an inter-ministerial committee that submitted its report in 2018. The committee devised several strategies and recommendations to double farmers’ income eventually insisting on the need of moving agriculture from being taken up as a subsistence activity to a profitable enterprise. From profitable, it means that the receipt from farming and allied activities should be good enough to cover the cost, meet family expenses, and still there should be a surplus that can be invested in adoption of good technologies by the farmer. Therefore, to increase farm incomes and to bring in farm income revolution, the country is committed to turn farming and allied activities into “enterprise” and farmer as an “entrepre-neur.” This gets support from a supportive policy environment that favors the growth of agribusiness systems. Several programs are also in place to support rural and agricultural entrepreneurship. Needless to say, agribusiness and entre-preneurship strategies could bring in much needed stability in rural India in terms of growth and development. Hence, “agribusiness” approaches and “agripreneurship” must be promoted aggressively. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.

AB  - Aim/purpose - This paper aims to introduce and describe a new paradigm (model) of evolutionary dynamism of family business potential in the succession process and its empirical simulation in family enterprises from culturally close "post-socialistic"countries: the Czech Republic and Poland. Design/methodology/approach - The conceptual basis for developing the evolutionary model of family business was our research on the sample of 235 small and medium-sized family enterprises from the Czech Republic and Poland. A practical experimental simulation of the model was carried out in 12 Czech and 19 Polish family companies. Findings - The proposed model is based on economic and natural laws, including optimization proportions of the golden ratio, laws of time economics, theory of innovation, and "Moore's law."This model allows us to simulate and analyze the pace of accelerating innovation cycles and the dynamism of intergenerational changes of family business potential in the succession process. Research implications/limitations - The social and industrial revolution 5.0 is getting near and global economic, social, cultural, ecological, and other contemporary turbulences, built on the "microcosm optimization"of living matter, having two extreme marginal variants for the subsequent (evolutionary) development of family business: (a) an option of "harmony"or (b) an option of "tragedy."One limitation of the model is its general nature, making it sensitive to outlier cases. Originality/value/contribution - The proposed model provides valuable analytical guidelines for family business succession and significantly highlights the role of intrafamily dynamics in this process. It also represents a novel analytical approach to assessing and predicting the longevity of family business as well as an opportunity for the development of mixed research in family entrepreneurship.  © 2023 Zdeněk Mikoláš et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting business closures have generated enormous losses to the world economy. One of the major victims of the COVID-19 outbreak are micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Due to the pandemic and induced lockdowns, this sector reported a sudden fall in demand and sales, unavailability of raw materials due to supply chain disruptions, transportation problems and finally business closures for many units throughout the country. The impacts of any crisis are never gender-neutral and as such it has affected everyone in some way or the other. While each individual faced unprecedented challenges, the women entrepreneurs also had to bear the brunt of the economic and social fallout from the COVID pandemic. Further, the strong negative repercussions of demanding household responsibilities, childcare, care of sick family members and all usual home chores amplified due to lockdown, affected the women, particularly in businesses everywhere. Thus, this paper aims to study the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on women micro businesses in the Cuttack city of Odisha. The objective of the study is to assess the impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on the socio-economic status of women entrepreneurs. The related hypothesis, which the study would attempt to test is that there is no impact of COVID 19 pandemic on the socio-economic conditions of the women entrepreneurs. The study is based on primary data from 40 samples collected through a semi-structured questionnaire. The study adopts a qualitative research design which is the thematic analysis, to highlight the impacts of the COVID-19 on their economic and social life. It has used descriptive statistics for the data analysis. The study reveals that the majority of respondents (women entrepreneurs) were severely affected by the pandemic and they faced several challenges related to financial and mental crises, increased household responsibilities, decrease in sales and demand, business closures, mobility problems etc. They also mentioned no significant Government support and only a few were able to adopt online businesses during the crisis. The study has a positive implication for the policymakers to take into consideration the needs and necessities of such women micro-entrepreneurs to support and empower them in their endeavour, as empowering a woman of a household, is like empowering the entire household for generations to come. © 2024 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - To succeed, a firm essentially needs to take the right amount of risk. Thus, the great significance of risk management has attracted many researchers to focus on how to implement enterprise risk management (ERM) systems most effectively. Generally, smaller entrepreneurial firms have to cope with this challenge more informally. Most manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are family companies; as a result, family dynamics greatly impact how such companies do business. The q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS) provides a wide window for the preference elicitation of decision-makers (DMs). Inspired by the advantages of the q-ROFS, in the current paper, a novel decision framework, the q-ROF-entropy-rank sum (RS)-additive ratio assessment (ARAS), called the “q-ROF-entropy-RS-ARAS” approach, is developed. The q-ROF-entropy-RS approach is applied to compute the weights of critical success factors (CSFs) for dynamic ERM in SMEs, and the q-ROF-ARAS model is used to assess enterprise preferences. An empirical case study is conducted to evaluate the CSFs for dynamic enterprise risk management in SMEs. Additionally, the comparison and sensitivity investigation are carried out to show the superiority of the developed framework. © 2022

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most important technologies of the future (Crew, 2020). So far, however, AI has been insufficiently deployed. This applies not only to family businesses, but especially to them. In terms of decision-making, these companies have a number of specific characteristics which mean that they find AI less relevant and may also be skeptical. The article discusses specifics of AI use in family businesses on the basis of a German empirical study. The paper shows that family businesses use AI less frequently and are also less open to the technology than non-family businesses. Socioemotional wealth (SEW) (Gómez-Mejia et al., 2007) serves as the theoretical basis. Based on the SEW, it is argued that although family businesses are aware of the need to apply new theories, they have so far underestimated the potentials and tend to be rather skeptical about applying these technologies. This view is supported by the empirical study. In addition, some differences between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large companies are also discussed in the paper. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - China’s family enterprises have entered the peak of intergenerational succession, and the succession of the second generation is bound to have a great impact on the development of these enterprises. From the perspective of the resource-based view, this paper constructs a relationship model among intergenerational succession, enterprise intellectual capital and market sustainable competitive advantage. Based on the data of a sample of 189 entrepreneurs from family firms in Zhejiang Province, we use multiple regression and structural equation modeling to explore the impact of intergenerational succession on the market sustainable competitive advantage of family firms and the mediating role of the three dimensions of the firm’s intellectual capital, namely, structural capital, relational capital and human capital. The empirical results show that (1) successful succession of a family business significantly promotes the market sustainable competitive advantage of the enterprise; (2) successful succession has a significant promotion effect on the three dimensions of enterprise intellectual capital, and the three dimensions of enterprise intellectual capital play a partial mediating role between intergenerational succession and the market sustainable competitive advantage of the enterprises. This conclusion expands the research on the consequences of intergenerational succession and has important practical significance for the healthy development of family enterprises in China. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Targeting A-share listed family firms on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchange, this study focuses on the special situation of state-owned equity participation in non-state-owned enterprises. Specifically, we explore the relationship between state-owned equity participation, intergenerational succession in family firms, and innovation investments. The results reveal a prominent “double-edged sword” effect of state-owned equity participation on family firms; that is, there is a reversed U-shaped relationship between shareholding proportion and innovation investment. To some extent, the intergenerational succession of family firms moderates the reversed U-shaped relationship. Moreover, the double-edged sword effect of state-owned equity is more prominent in family businesses that are created by the entrepreneur from scratch. Compared to existing research arguing for the linear relationship between state-owned equity participation and innovation investment by enterprises, we reveal the impact of the excessive supervision effect arising from the increase in state-owned equity holdings on family firms’ innovation. This study confirms the double-edged sword effect of state-owned equity participation in family firms and further explores the influence of intergenerational succession and the heterogeneity of family firms on such an effect. By revealing the double-edged sword effect of state-owned equity holdings, this study enriches the research on the participation of private enterprises in mixed-ownership reform. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to explore the use, effectiveness, motives and obstacles of analytical procedures (APs) used by auditors in Palestine, a context characterised by a pool of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), a limited skill set, poor quality of data, political uncertainty and a community-based business culture. Design/methodology/approach: The study considers the audit market in Palestine using a sequential mixed-methods approach combining a questionnaire survey and a series of in-depth interviews. A total of 129 Big-4 and non-Big-4 auditors were surveyed. Findings: The use of APs is driven by the auditor size (Big-4 vs non-Big-4) and the client size (large vs SMEs). Even though the use of APs has increased over the past decade, audit objectives, know-how, and personal, family and social connections among auditors and clients influence the quality of the audit process. Practical implications: Small firms take advantage of the lack of audit governance in Palestine. Our findings suggest that the regulators should help bridge the knowledge-sharing programmes between the small and large audit firms to help improve audit quality. Originality/value: Studies on audit quality, particularly using APs, in the context of politically unstable cases such as Palestine are limited. The study has implications for the use of APs in the case of SMEs to prepare for the technological revolution that will modernise audit procedures and quality soon. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Manufacturing has experienced an immense transformation since the emergence of Industry 4.0. Digitalization has substantially improved production efficiency and product quality, and innovative business models have emerged. The backbone of emerging countries like India comprises small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that provide jobs for millions of families. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) account for around 31% of the nation's GDP and 43% of 2021-2022 exports, both significant contributors to economic growth when there is a substantial labour pool. Therefore, they are often known as India's growth engine. Unfortunately, in today's highly competitive digital market, they fail to keep pace with technological innovations and keep their employees up to date. This article discusses the significance of digitalization for India's SMEs, addressing the hurdles and the methods to remove them. New consumer markets have been established due to government programs like Make in India, Digital India, and E-Government. © 2024 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.

AB  - This chapter focuses on the corporate social responsibility (CSR) framework in India with respect to achieving a net-zero economy. It provides an in-depth exploration of the stipulations applicable to companies in India concerning their corporate social responsibilities and addresses the ecological, social, and economic impacts of corporate operations on diverse communities. The imperative to achieve a net-zero economy is underscored by the escalating global mean temperature, wherein mere removal of an equivalent carbon amount from the atmosphere fails to offset the rise. CSR embodies a commitment by business enterprises to spearhead economic development while mitigating the adverse impacts on a minimal scale. This commitment ensures a substantial enhancement in the living standards of the workforce, their families, local communities, and society at large. Furthermore, the chapter critically examines how corporate behavior is influenced by CSR and elucidates how CSR initiatives play a pivotal role in attaining net-zero emissions. The growing environmental awareness among consumers regarding the ecological footprint of certain products compels corporations to embrace CSR obligations, to enhance the appeal of their eco-friendly products. The authors present empirical research illuminating the CSR landscape in India and its impact on achieving a net-zero economy. Startling findings reveal that despite organizations adhering to laid-down rules and regulations, there is a profound lack of awareness among the populace regarding the legal framework governing CSR. The study emphasizes the need for heightened awareness to bridge this gap and propel sustainable practices in the corporate landscape. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

In this context, CoPs that jointly involve family and non-family members are expected to act as knowledge-sharing tools. Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs a multiple case study methodology, analysing the cases of six small companies in different sectors and countries over a period of 8 years. Both primary and secondary data are used. Findings: The results show the role CoPs play in involving family and non-family members in empowering knowledge-sharing initiatives. A CoP's role in knowledge sharing depends on the presence (or lack) of a family leader, the leadership approach, the degree of cohesion around shared approaches and values within the CoP, and the presence of multiple generations at work. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the literature on knowledge sharing in family businesses, by exploring for the first time the role of the CoP as a knowledge-sharing tool, depending on families' involvement in the CoP. © 2023, Francesca Rossignoli, Andrea Lionzo, Thomas Henschel and Börje Boers.

AB  - Innovation offers prerequisites for enterprises to construct core competitiveness, which is the power source for family firms to maintain sustainable development. In recent years, with researchers′ further analysis of the internal family governance structure, more and more scholars have called for the study of family firm innovation to pay more attention to the heterogeneity within the family firm group, rather than simply comparing family firms with non-family firms. As a more prevalent family governance model, the influential role of co-ownership by couples in the development of family firms is becoming increasingly prominent. Several studies have been conducted to explore the impact of couple combinations on corporate risk decisions, however, they came to different conclusions. It may be exposed to the following factors: first, the suitability of the theoretical basis. The theoretical perspective of femininity overemphasizes the role of wives and pays less attention to the synergy of couples; The research of social-emotional wealth theory and agency theory is mainly concentrated on the exploration of the enterprise level, as a consequence, it is tough to clarify the impacts of different kinships on the differentiation of enterprises. Second, the inconsistency of the concept range of couple combinations. Marital ownership and marital leadership are the cruxes of defining the couple combination for the current research, whereas, there are essential differences between them. Third, there are no clear boundary conditions for the research, especially for the couple′s relationship with the family system, and the financial status with the enterprise system. Considering that there are some deficiencies in the existing research, this paper attempts to explore the impact of co-shareholding by couples on corporate innovation investment based on the perspective of marital contract. To be more specific, compared with other family governance models, the commitment mechanism of the marital contract promotes the consciousness of risk-sharing in a long term between the couples, the reciprocity of the marital contract lays the foundation of long-term cooperation, and the consistent goal of maximizing family wealth under the marital contract forms a long-term incentive for the couple′s collaboration. Accordingly, this paper holds that under the synergy of formal and informal marital contracts, the couples′ relationship is conducive to inspiring the foundation of trust, institution, emotion, and career, formulating the innovation for family enterprises, that is to say, co-shareholding by couples contribute to the innovative investment. In addition, considering that under the influence of marriage contracts, the innovation promotion effect of couples′ co-shareholding will be affected by the two systems of family and business, this paper explores the moderating effect of couple differences and business distress. In further research, this paper attempts to take the long-term orientation as a clue to shed light on the path mechanism of co-shareholding by couples to promote enterprise innovation investment. This paper cites Chinese family-listed companies from 2008—2016 as the research samples, the results indicates that: 1) compared with other family governance models, co-ownership by couples is more conducive to stimulating corporate innovation, and this result is still valid after a variety of robustness tests, such as instrumental variable method, propensity score matching, placebo test, exclusion of alternative explanation and so on; 2) The difference between couples has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between couples′ common property rights and enterprise innovation. That is, the gaps in education and Confucian culture between the couple will weaken the positive effect of co-ownership by couples on corporate innovation. Business distress positively moderates the relationship between co-ownership by couples and corporate innovation. That is, corporate innovation will be benefited from the current organizational decline and expected earnings pressure under the co-shareholding mode by couples; 3) Further study reveals that the main reason why co-ownership by couples can promote corporate innovation is that this kind of governance model is conducive to promoting long-term orientation. The theoretical contributions and practical insights are as follows. First, this paper deconstructs the governance mechanism within the family system by taking the marriage contract as the entry point. It casts light on the essential differences between the co-ownership by couples and other family governance models, offering a new theoretical perspective to reveal the driving force of corporate innovation. Consequently, encouraging co-entrepreneurship not only attaches great significance to enhancing entrepreneurial dynamics, but also contributes to the overall innovation strength of the country. Second, this paper expands the boundary conditions of co-ownership by couples to promote corporate innovation investment. Especially for the relationship conflict effect of spousal differences, which conveys that it is imperative to reasonably allocate and coordinate the couples′ complementary skills and power in the enterprise management practice, so as to avoid the negative impact of the relationship conflict on corporate innovation. Third, this paper opens the black-box of the innovation-promoting effect of co-ownership by couples from the perspective of long-term orientation. Thus, in order to enhance enterprises to make a more great contribution to the high-quality development of China′s economy, it is particularly critical to maximize the long-term orientation of family members. © (2024), (Zhejiang University).

AB  - While digitalisation has significant implications for environmental management activities, this nexus has received minimal attention in research. Given this backdrop, this study uses a unique survey dataset of 386 micro and small enterprises (MSEs) and conducts an OLS regression analysis to examine the impact of digitalisation on environmental management activities. The study also investigates how family ownership moderates this relationship. The study finds that digitalisation supports environmental management activities as an important strategic mechanism, and that family ownership has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between digitalisation and environmental management activities. This study contributes to ‘institutional theory’ by highlighting its applicability to the new context of MSEs in emerging markets. Further, the study provides managerial insights into how to ensure environmental management practices in the digital age. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - How do family values endure decades after an enterprise is no longer a family business? Addressing this question has been a challenge in social theory, and it is an issue of particular concern for family businesses where firm and family values are often indistinguishable. We analyze the transmission of family, organizational, and religious values across generations in Cadbury, a multinational confectionary company founded in England in 1824. We identify sacralization as a central process that explains Cadbury’s success in transferring values across time and different organizational structures. We describe how sacralization is driven by moralization, communion, and syncretism. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Female entrepreneurship drives tourism development in resource-scarce destinations but little is known about why local women engage in business and what determines their success in a time of a life event crisis. This knowledge is important as it can support policies on regional regeneration and poverty alleviation. This study draws upon the Bourdieu's model of practice with its notions of capital, agents, field, and habitus to examine the experiences of women running tourism enterprises in a destination with the legacy of an anthropogenic environmental disaster, the Aral Sea region. Semi-structured interviews with women entrepreneurs in Uzbekistan (n = 18) and Kazakhstan (n = 15) showcase prevalence of the necessity-based and extrinsic motivations in a time of crisis. Interviews also demonstrate the importance of social capital women entrepreneurs built with such agents of entrepreneurial practice as family, friends, policymakers, employees, and competitors. The original contribution of the study is in revealing how local cultural traditions reinforce various types of capital, strengthen the field of knowledge, and shape habitus of women entrepreneurs in critical times. Another original contribution is in highlighting how the experience of past life event crises has aided in psychological coping of women tourism entrepreneurs during COVID-19. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The current evolution of global value chains (GVCs) calls for moving beyond the “unipolar” view of lead multinational enterprises (MNEs) as sole rulers to examine how their characteristics and those of partner firms affect GVC governance. In response to this call, we focus on family firms, which are the most ubiquitous organizational form worldwide and represent the majority of firms participating in GVCs. Unlike non-family firms, these organizations face distinct mixed gambles, driven by both economic and non-economic goals. However, internalization theory and the associated global factory model, which explain GVC governance, rely solely on economic assessments, limiting our understanding and predictability of MNE behavior. Therefore, in this study, we show how location decisions, degree of internalization, and relationship management in GVCs differ from the conventional global factory model when family firms are involved as lead MNEs and/or partners. By analyzing how comparative efficiency considerations change when family firms are involved, we offer implications for internalization theory and provide a more comprehensive framework for understanding control and trust dynamics in GVCs. Thus, we pave the way for future research to revise and enrich international business theories, taking into account the distinctiveness and heterogeneity of family firms. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Among the various global options for self-employment, venturing into the micro-enterprise sector has been recognized as an important way for employment generation and poverty alleviation in many developing/ emerging economies. In this context, women-owned businesses at the grassroots play a vital role in developing countries like India far beyond contributing to job creation and economic growth. The informal sector is a sizeable and expanding feature of the contemporary global economy. However, the informal economy operates at the cusp of the institutional framework, which makes them susceptible to many risks like lack of formal financing options, legal aid or increasing margin through access to formal markets. Non-Profit Development Agencies (NPDAs) have emerged as a viable and essential middle ground support in promoting women entrepreneurship in their capacity to contribute beyond governmental institutions. The study adopted an inductive qualitative option through a case study design to explore the approaches adopted by NPDAs in promoting micro-entrepreneurship among women at the base of the pyramid (BoP) in the urban informal sector in India. The findings suggest that the NPDAs created an impact through the services, which translated into monetary earnings for the entrepreneurs. They could make financial contributions to their families, which boosted their self-confidence and overall personality. The findings also indicate positive changes like increased self-confidence, self-dependence, and inner strength as reported by the entrepreneurs. © 2023 Sujata Mukherjee and Santana Pathak.

AB  - Introduction: Empowering women in a tribal context through entrepreneurship is an approach for enabling and making them economically and socially viable. This paper aims to highlight entrepreneurship in a specific tribal context and provide insight on some instances or cases relating to women's empowerment. Although there are many initiatives from international organizations and governmental institutions to support women entrepreneurs, especially tribal women, they suffer from isolation as a result of their language and lifestyle differ from the rest of society, which made the growth of their business and ability to compete arduous, and thus affected their ability to make various decisions in their lives. This study examines the pathway to a better understanding of increasing access to entrepreneurship for tribal women in Mayurbhanj district, Odisha. Methods: The sample size was 111 Santhal tribal women entrepreneurs, and all of them were interviewed using an interview schedule and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs). Two analytical tools were used (a linear regression model to find which dependent variables influence entrepreneurs and the Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) to measure the progress in social and economic opportunities). The respondents was interviewed and asked on the various WEI indicators before and after an entrepreneurship intervention. Results and discussion: It was observed through the results that the empowerment of women has changed in a positive direction after establishing their work; according to the indicators of the study, the Women's Empowerment Index has changed from 0.61 to 1.26. It was also found that entrepreneurship has a positive and significant impact on women's decision-making within the family, and therefore, it was suggested through research to increase the intervention from the government and related organizations with more initiatives that contribute to the possibility of increasing women's education and their financial ability to open new enterprises.

AB  - Purpose: Because family businesses are highly complex enterprises, researchers need appropriate theoretical and methodological tools to study them. The neoconfigurational perspective and its accompanying method, qualitative comparative analysis, are particularly well suited to phenomena characterized by complex causality, but their uptake in family business research has been slow and fragmented. To remedy this, the authors highlight their unique ability to address research questions for which other approaches are not well suited and discuss how they might be applied to family business phenomena. Design/methodology/approach: The authors introduce the core tenets of the neoconfigurational perspective and how its set-theoretic epistemology differs from traditional approaches to theorizing and analysis. The authors then use a dataset of family firms to present a primer on conducting qualitative comparative analysis and interpreting the results. Findings: The authors find that family firm resources can be combined in multiple ways to affect business survival, suggesting that resources are substitutable and complementary. The authors discuss how the unique features of the neoconfigurational approach, namely equifinality, conjunctural causation and causal asymmetry, can be fruitfully applied to break new ground in scholarly understanding of family businesses. Originality/value: This article allows family business researchers to apply the neoconfigurational approach without first having to consult multiple and disparate sources often written for other disciplines. This article explicates how to leverage the theoretical and empirical advantages of the neoconfigurational approach in the context of family businesses, supporting a more widespread adoption of the neoconfigurational perspective in family business research. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The southeast Asian new immigrants face significant barriers in employment due to language and cultural differences, making it challenging for them to find jobs. Consequently, many southeast Asian immigrants have turned to entrepreneurship as a means to achieve economic independence and contribute to their family’s income. This study adopts entrepreneurial marketing (EM) as a theoretical lens and utilizes a process research methodology, based on sequentially ordered events, to explore the entrepreneurial journey of immigrant micro and small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Employing purposive sampling, twenty-two southeast Asian immigrant entrepreneurs were selected for in-depth interviews to ensure data quality through multiple data collection methods. The research developed a dynamic adjustment model and management mechanisms for the entrepreneurial marketing of immigrant micro and SMEs. These findings not only bridge theoretical gaps in immigrant entrepreneurship strategy but also deepen the academic understanding of the dynamism in entrepreneurial marketing. Practically, the outcomes assist immigrant micro and small business entrepreneurs in developing operational strategies and serve as a reference for governmental units in crafting immigrant policies. © 2024 by the author.

AB  - Liabilities of smallness, family relations, leadership style, and preferences are all reasons why owners of small and medium-sized family enterprises (family SMEs) apply procedures to manage employees inconsistently. For family and non-family employees of family SMEs, inconsistencies in human resource management (HRM) may be a source of frustration that hampers their performance and wellbeing. Using a sample of 713 respondents in 116 family SMEs, we examined how HRM consistency as a whole, and as three HRM bundles (ability, motivation, and opportunity) could enhance the perceived organizational justice of employees in family SMEs, and whether this differs for family and non-family employees. We indeed found that HRM consistency is a condition for perceived organizational justice of employees and that this effect was more pronounced for non-family employees than for family employees. We explain this difference by the distinct environment where the fairness heuristics of employees developed. Where non-family employees develop their fairness heuristics only in the business sphere, family employees start to develop their fairness heuristics earlier on in the family sphere. We also found evidence that inconsistencies in the motivation-enhancing HRM bundle were most susceptible to negative perceptions of organizational justice. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: This study analyses the sequence of actions carried out by successful enterprises in the agricultural sector and aims to understand the logic followed with such actions and the differences related to the types of families that develop them. Design/methodology/approach: Through a multiple case study approach, the business and family trajectories of 14 successful agricultural enterprises in Mexico were analysed. The actions carried out by enterprises are conceptualized as strategic movements and are classified into seven categories: (1) growth and intensification, (2) reconversion, (3) diversification, (4) integration, (5) differentiation, (6) outsourcing and (7) digitization. Depending on their relationship with agriculture, entrepreneurial families are classified into three categories: (1) continuing families, (2) returning families and (3) incoming families. Findings: The entrepreneurship logic follows three stages: evaluation, expansion and consolidation, through which different activities are tested, then the one that produces the best results is expanded and adopted as the main activity, and finally the expansion of the main activity and its evaluation are combined by comparing and complementing it with other agricultural activities. The difference is that continuing families adhere more to the traditional productivist model based on growth in scale and improved productivity of primary production. On the other hand, actions that imply a distinction in the quality of production such as integration and differentiation and that require links with other organizations such as outsourcing are more frequently carried out by returning and incoming families. Research limitations/implications: The findings obtained through case studies cannot be statistically generalized to a specific population, however, our perspective can be transferred to other cases to obtain analogous findings. Originality/value: The study is a unique piece in terms of the analysis of how families with different degrees of proximity to agriculture develop successful enterprises. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The growing importance of family businesses in the global economy is related to the specificity of their activities, the increase in their contribution to GDP creation or providing jobs. It prompted the authors of this article to research these particular entities belonging to the small business. Considering the different economic conditions caused by the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, the aim of the work was to examine and identify the strategies implemented among family enterprises from the SME sector in Poland in the period immediately preceding the COVID-19 pandemic (2018–2019) and during this pandemic (2020–2021). It was achieved through analyzing the literature of the subject, development of our own research method, analyzing the results of primary research, presenting conclusions and making recommendations for science and economic practices. The authors formulated research hypotheses verified within the framework of the conducted research. The research is of a pioneering nature and was designed in such a way as to present the similarities and differences between the classes of enterprises under study (micro, small and medium-sized), as well as the research periods in terms of the development strategies applied by them. In this respect, appropriate research methods were selected. The study combined qualitative methods (critical analysis of existing explanations of the concept and essence of family enterprises; review of the literature on enterprise development in the light of Industry 4.0) with quantitative methods (analysis of the taxonomy of structures based on the similarity index of the studied structures; comparative analysis by cross-tabulation). To perform the research thus planned, the authors’ study on the systematization of development strategies in family enterprises was adopted. Implementing strategies among family enterprises in the SME sector seems to be crucial in their development. As the results show, this is of particular importance in crisis periods. The pandemic crisis was particular, and the functioning of enterprises during it was problematic. Some of them had to suspend their activities, some ceased their operations altogether, and those that survived were successful. The path leading to this success was the specific development strategies that were implemented by the family businesses in the SME sector surveyed. It is therefore worthwhile, both from an academic point of view and from a business practice point of view, to learn about these strategies. The authors have identified and described them and presented the resulting conclusions for the future. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Chinese family businesses are currently undergoing a crucial period of transformation, innovation, and leadership transition. One central question arises: is there effective ‘coupling’ or ineffective ‘decoupling’ between the organizational legitimacy and the legitimate authority of professional managers in these businesses? These dynamics are significant factors influencing the strategic decision-making processes of family enterprises. The coupling model is utilized to analyze the degree of coupling and the evolution of coherence between the organizational legitimacy and the legitimate authority of professional managers from 2017 to 2021. Key findings include: (1) The relationship between the organizational legitimacy of family businesses and the legitimate authority of professional managers exhibits a dynamic characteristic of borderline disorder, with the legitimacy of enterprise organizations lagging relatively; (2) The degree and coherence of the legitimacy system show noticeable temporal fluctuations; (3) Discrepancies between legitimate subsystems significantly hinder coupling and coordinated development. The research also proposes relevant countermeasures and suggestions to promote effective legitimacy coupling between enterprise organizations and the authority of professional managers in Chinese family businesses. These measures aim to foster the high-quality development of family enterprises and the private economy. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - As the grassroots-party organizations of the Communist Party of China (CPC) are increasingly involved in the governance of private-owned enterprises (POEs), whether this new pattern promotes corporate innovation is still a research gap. Therefore, based on the data of 1357 POEs’ party-organization involvements and their patent applications from 2003 to 2017, this paper analyzes the impact of the party-organization involvements on corporate innovation by using the multiple regression model. The results include: (1) party-organization involvements including party organization activities and senior executives’ participation can significantly promote innovation, especially after 2012; (2) party-organization activities improve innovation by increasing research and development (R&D) investment and reducing operating risk, while the senior executives’ participation only influences on R&D investment; (3) the party-organization involvements have a stronger promotion on non-invention patent applications, especially for the utility-model-patent applications, than invention-patent applications; (4) the promotion is more pronounced for family businesses, technology-intensive and capital-intensive enterprises, as well as those located in the northern, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and Yangtze River delta. After applying PSM sampling and difference-in-differences (DID) analyses, and substituting the dependent variables, the results remain robust. This paper provides Chinese evidence for party construction and corporate innovation, and also provides references about political connection and corporate innovation for other countries to some extent. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze how the maturity stages of the adoption of circular economy practices are related to the circular economy business models. The study highlights a case study in which original datasets were collected through an in-depth interview within 10 analysis units and secondary sources. The case study examines the Santa Catarina Association of Fine Wine Producers of Height (ACAVITIS), a group that includes 28 associates. The relationship identified between the maturity stages and the practices of circular economy provides evidence that will fulfil the premises of the ReSOLVE Model and the 5Rs. Contributions/value: These evidences contribute to highlight the following contributions of the study: (i) circular economy has relation with stages of maturity of the analysed business models; (ii) advanced stages of maturity, that is, between 3 and 5 are interfaced with a variety of practices of circular economy; (iii) duration of the enterprise, level of education and portfolio of manufactured products do not have a strong direct relationship with the engagement with the circular economy; (iv) the practices of circular economy are already established in the analysed units of analysis, but they demand optimisation and management to make them more efficient and that can impact even more positively in the family wine production model. It is suggested that new studies be carried out to confirm and generalize the findings of this research, especially those that test hypotheses evidencing the relationship between circular economy practices and maturity stages of business models. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Entrepreneurship is often considered a key means to tackling the ongoing challenge of poverty among the rural populations in developing countries. We study how drawing on the support of various stakeholders—specifically family, community, and business partners—helps overcome institutional voids and foster entrepreneurship in Indian microenterprises. We also examine how the adoption of digital technologies—e.g., in the form of smartphone apps—can strengthen those relationships. By surveying more than 1,000 microentrepreneurs in rural India, we find that both the families and communities (in particular self-help groups) of entrepreneurs have a positive and significant effect on entrepreneurship that is strengthened when digital technologies are used. Support from business partners, however, is negatively associated with entrepreneurship. © 2021

AB  - Family enterprises in China have significant impact on China's social and economic development. Yet did technological innovation in Chinese family enterprise play a role on this impact? We examine the role that technology innovation played in the rise in importance of Chinese family businesses. We analyze the impact of family enterprises on companies’ technological innovation through both family ownership and family management involvement. We further scrutinize how Chinese family-owned business internationalization strategies affected their technological innovation activities. The authors show that family ownership without family management involvement has a negative relations with companies’ technical innovation. We further demonstrate that family ownerships with family management involvement have a positive relations with enterprises’ technical innovation. Our study provides some effective measures to increase the investment in firms’ technical innovation and minimize the disadvantages of family business. The research result has practical significance in the governance of family enterprises. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - India has the third highest number of family-owned businesses (FoBs) globally, yet their intergenerational survival is at risk. The country faces a steep decline in female labor force participation and a “youth bulge,” with 54 percent of the population below the age of 25. The postpandemic era has necessitated the need for small and medium-sized enterprises to reinvent themselves to adapt to the fast-paced digital landscape. The perceptions of human capital and the inclusion of women in family business succession planning are often ignored. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship of nonfamily employees and gender inclusivity on the survival of family-owned businesses. The authors propose a more inclusive culture in the FoB landscape as they undertake an ethnographic study to review literature between 2017 and 2022 while highlighting the impact of organizational culture to achieve gender egalitarianism and aid the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. © 2022 International Council for Small Business.

AB  - Efficient management at family businesses, like all other enterprises, requires the use of appropriate methods and tools. However, in many cases, the people managing these entities do not have any formal business education and often follow their intuition and act on experience gained over the years. The purpose of this article is to determine the extent to which select management methods and tools are used in Polish family businesses and to examine their impact on the effectiveness of achieving various objectives. A survey was conducted on a group of 182 managers of family businesses from Poland, who were asked about the effectiveness of achieving goals and the methods and tools used in management. The goals have been aggregated into three main groups: family goals, business goals, and a mix of family and business goals. Then, using statistical methods, the impact of the selected management methods and tools on the effectiveness of these three groups of objectives was examined. The conducted analysis has shown that family businesses in Poland make little use of professional management methods and tools and are rather limited to the intuitive use of the simplest methods, which they often cannot even professionally name. The research results indicate that the use of these methods only partially influences the effectiveness of achieving the set goals, and this impact can be observed in all three groups. In view of the above, the basic task of the broader family business environment is to improve the knowledge of professional management methods and tools among family business managers. From the scientific point of view, further research in this area is also necessary because little use of management methods and tools, especially those more professional, makes it difficult to broaden the study of the actual impact of these instruments on the effectiveness of achieving family business objectives. © Foundation of International Studies, 2022.

AB  - Platform-based crowdsourcing manufacturing has recently garnered wide attention as it is a business model that facilitates economies of scale and cost efficiency in production. The inherent coupling of process planning and production scheduling (PPPS) in a platform-based crowdsourcing manufacturing environment necessitates collaborative optimisation of PPPS decisions. Existing research that assumes PPPS decisions are integrated into one static single-level optimisation problem becomes no longer applicable with the arrival of the crowdsourcing mode. This paper presents a dynamic hierarchical collaborative optimisation (DHCO) mechanism that considers a process planning to interact with scheduling according to the optimal decision of the open manufacturing platform. A bilevel mixed 0-1 nonlinear programming model is established with the platform acting as the leader and the manufacturing enterprises serving as the follower. It is solved by a nested genetic algorithm (NGA). A case study of a part family is presented to illustrate feasibility of DHCO. Through comparative experiments, it is found that integrating crowdsourcing strategies into process planning activities is advisable for a platform to increase competitive advantages. The proposed model can manage well the conflict and collaboration between PPPS and balances the benefits of a platform with the manufacturing enterprise impacts triggered by planning activities.

AB  - Suppliers play the vital role of ensuring the continuous supply of goods to the market for businesses. If businesses do not maintain a strong bond with their suppliers, they may not be able to secure a steady supply of goods and products for their customers. As a result of failure to deliver products, the production and business activities of the business can be delayed which leads to the loss of customers. Normally, each trading enterprise will have a variety of commodity supply chains with multiple suppliers. Suppliers play an important role and contribute to the value of the entire supply chain. Should any supplier encounters a problem, the whole supply chain of businesses will be affected and could lead to not guaranteeing the stable supply to the market. Thus, suppliers can be seen as a threat to businesses where they have the ability to increase input prices or decrease the quality of the required products and services they provide. The quantity of the business, and the supply lead time directly affect the operations and reduce the profitability of the business. The paper mainly focuses on the supplier selection problem under a variety of price level and product families when using a two-phase fuzzy multi-objective linear programming. The objectives of the proposed model are to minimize the total purchasing and ordering cost in order to reduce the quantity of defective materials and the late-delivery components from suppliers. Moreover, the piecewise linear membership function is applied in the model to determine an optimal solution which is based on the requirement of decision makers under their fuzzy environment. The results of this study can be applied in various business environment and provide a reliable decision tool for choosing potential suppliers relating to these objectives. Based on the results, the company can make a good decision on supplier selection; therefore, the company can improve the quality and quantity of their final product. This is because, the best supplier can supply raw material using just-in-time application and reduce production risk on the manufacturing process. © 2021 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Komal International, India is a family-run enterprise [also called small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in India] catering to the home decor business. In its mission to become a ‘direct’ business partner (supplier) to several MNCs1, Komal International noticed specific challenges to become a ‘compliance-ready’2 export company. Consequently, the company embarked on identifying the relevant external and internal factors. The external factors were identified after assessing several MNCs that indirectly procured products manufactured by Komal International or were listed as their prospective buyers. This assessment and restructuring of its internal functioning allowed alignment with the needs of ‘compliance-ready’ export business. And in turn it provided the ability to survive in a competitive market. Purpose: This case study aims to identify challenges faced by the prospective family businesses (a supplier) to become a ‘compliance-ready’ supplier for the offshore MNCs (buyer) in the home decor market. The challenges were identified by conducting a structured questionnaire followed by a personal interview with existing and prospective buyers; further, modifications in the internal company policies lead to making a ‘compliance-ready’ supplier, useful in finding new export markets. Methodology: The approach was qualitative and included a series of in-person interviews3 with the management of the company over one year, assessing the concepts of family business internationalization as a theory, and from secondary published sources on home decor sector. As such, it was a case analysis to comprehend best practices in a family business to fulfil its vision. Basis of the Case: Phenomenon based. Type of the Case: Applied decisional. Protagonist: Present. Theory: The approach is to examine the relevance of ‘internationalization theory’ for a family business in India. Specifically, we shall, through a case study, investigate the business model adopted by an export ‘compliance-ready’ small family business to thrive in a competitive environment. Research Question: Komal International is a decade-old family business with a vision to provide home decor items globally. The protagonist, having examined the existing business model by considering the internationalization theory and the regulatory environment, has identified two specific challenges. The first is to understand the ‘compliance-ready’ strategy that in turn necessitates the internal policies to be streamlined for its business growth as a ‘direct’ exporter to MNCs. And the second is to meet an ambitious export prospect. The research question is attempted by using the internationalization theory and analysing its role as a supplier to MNCs and becoming ‘compliance-ready’ by modifying its internal company policies. Findings: The significant results suggested are the possible best practices that family businesses such as were embraced by Komal International that are aspirant to become a direct supplier to offshore MNCs may be considered for adopting. These include reworking many internal policies of the company considering (a) the internationalization theory, (b) opportunities from the revised regulatory environment established for Indian SMEs and (c) the opportunities in the global marketplace. By adopting changes within the company, the supplier side (for the buyers’ acceptance as a compliance-ready company) can be strengthened. The findings can be useful to entrepreneurs, specifically family businesses, keen on internationalization. It will be of value to researchers and other SMEs (this definition includes family-run business) in India and globally. The limitations of the study include defining quality parameters based on product specifications and small sample size in interviewing MNCs. The research experiment can be extended to include country-specific analysis, trade trends and cultural analysis. © 2020 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Even though family firms are characterized by an overlap between the family and business systems, family business research has focused separately on how family firms compete (i. e., strategic behavior) and how families are involved their firms (i. e., types of family orientation). With the aim of closing this research gap, we draw on the heterogeneity principle of family firms and the equifinality principle of the configurative approach to conjecture that family firms can successfully adjust their strategic behavior and family business orientation in a variety of ways to enhance their likelihood of survival. We follow a sample of Spanish family firms over an 11-year period (2004-2015) to test our model. Based on the Kaplan-Meier survival estimator and the Cox proportional hazard model, we find that survival likelihood is higher when firms combine a differentiation strategy with a business-first or a family-enterprise-first orientation or when firms follow a low-cost strategy with a family-first orientation.  © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Purpose: The knowledge of goals of the successor, who is preparing to take over the business, is extremely important for the succession process and further operation of a family enterprise. The aim of this study is to structure the goals of Polish family enterprises’ successors and to develop a Synthetic Model of the goals of Polish family enterprises' successors with the application of grey clustering evaluation models. Design/methodology/approach: Research into the specifics of the diagnosis and assessment of the goals set for the successors of the first succession in family businesses in Poland was carried out in the third quarter of 2016 at two stages using two research methods: in-depth group interview and individual interview. The main aim of the first stage was the extraction of subjectively identified goals by family enterprises' successors (based on their succession experience). The statements were open and obtained during two in-depth group interviews (2 FGI) with successors being in the process of succession at its various stages (total, n = 14). The respondents presented their experiences connected with the succession process along with emotions that are associated with it. In one of the interview stages, the respondents were asked to enumerate their individual goals they set for themselves in the context of upcoming changes. Next, the group agreed on the most frequently mentioned goals by creating their verbal interpretation. The obtained list of 20 goals was recorded and discussed, and thanks to the application of the elimination rule in the collective decision-making process, that list was reduced to 10 goals, which was approved by all participating successors. Findings: The results show the developed Synthetic Model of the goals of family enterprises’ successors. The study singled out four groups of successors: (1) successors who do not work in the family enterprise yet, (2) successors holding lower-level positions, (3) successors holding managerial positions, (4) successors who manage the entire company. As a result of the calculations, the developed Synthetic Model of the goals of family enterprises' successors was positively verified for successors working in higher-level positions and successors managing the entire family enterprise. Research limitations/implications: In order to use the results of clustering, e.g. for conducting studies on large samples with the use of statistical tools, a reduced number of goals should be taken into account. A thorough study of three goals may bring results similar to the study of the original ten successors of Polish family enterprises in the process of succession. The aim of future research is to develop a mathematical model using optimization functions that enable selection of elements representing individual clusters in such a way that it leads to the extraction of the elements with the highest value in relation to the accepted criterion for assessing their value. Originality/value: In the future, conducting family business research in accordance with the developed methodology requires a look at the proposed list of successor goals obtained during the Focus Group Interview (FGI) as it could be shortened using the Cluster of Grey Incidence method. Shortening the list of goals has its analytic and practical justifications. The study of the full list of goals in subsequent (and numerous further studies) could lead to errors related to, for example, different interpretation of goals among the investigated successors. Furthermore, the full list of goals would increase costs and extend research time. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The study compares the impact of the interactions between organizational capabilities and business strategic orientation on performance for micro and small family businesses (FBs) and non-family businesses (NFBs). We use data from 207 FBs and 293 NFBs from Ghana to test our hypotheses. The findings indicate that the impact of the interaction between managerial capabilities and cost strategy on performance was more beneficial for FBs than NFBs. Moreover, the influence of the interaction between marketing capabilities and cost leadership strategy on performance was more detrimental to FBs than NFBs. Furthermore, the impact of the interaction between marketing capabilities and differentiation strategy on performance was greater for NFBs than FBs. The findings show that while FBs benefit more by leveraging managerial capabilities to pursue the cost leadership strategy, NFBs benefit more by leveraging marketing capabilities to implement the differentiation strategy. Implications are discussed. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The academic research of family-owned small and medium enterprises (SMEs) has undergone significant growth over the past several decades. Many researchers hold that the succession of founder-CEOs represents one of the most important challenges faced by family firms known as family-owned SMEs. Family firms rarely plan for succession. This is an important oversight committed by most family firms. Succession planning, however, likely remains one of the primary causes for the success, growth, and legacy of family firms. To address this issue, a conceptual model for founder-CEO succession planning in family firms was developed to improve family business commitment, continuity, and tacit knowledge transfer for child successors. © 2020 International Council for Small Business.

AB  - While evidence that contradicts a discipline's hard core assumptions is essential to scientific progress, its accumulation is made difficult by the protective nature of the middle range theories that protect it. For this reason, progress tends to be most common in response to external shocks that expose the limitations of traditional ways of thinking. Given the impact COVID-19 has had on our collective understanding of business (family or otherwise), we propose that evidence against the hard core has reached the point where new thinking is necessary if we are to advance the field in productive ways. As the authors in this special issue demonstrate, such progress can be made by leveraging our intellectual roots in the social sciences. By looking to fields such as anthropology, sociology, jurisprudence, political science, and economics for inspiration, these authors use the current crisis as an opportunity to envision the future of family business scholarship. © 2022

AB  - The second half of the 20th century is commonly considered to be a time in which German companies lost their innovative strength, while promising new technologies presented an enormous potential for innovation in the US. The fact that German companies were quite successful in the production of medium data technology and had considerable influence on the development of electronic data processing was neglected by business and media historians alike until now. The article analyses the Siemag Feinmechanische Werke (Eiserfeld) as one of the most important producers of the predecessors to said medium data technologies in the 1950s and 1960s. Two transformation processes regarding the media-from mechanic to semiconductor and from semiconductor to all-electronic technology-Are highlighted in particular. It poses the question of how and why a middling family enterprise such as Siemag was able to rise to being the leading provider for medium data processing office computers despite lacking expertise in the field of electrical engineering while also facing difficult location conditions. The article shows that Siemag successfully turned from its roots in heavy industry towards the production of innovative high technology devices. This development stems from the company's strategic decisions. As long as their products were not mass-produced, a medium-sized family business like Siemag could hold its own on the market through clever decision-making which relied on flexible specialization, targeted license and patent cooperation as well as innovative products, even in the face of adverse conditions. Only in the second half of the 1960s, as profit margins dropped due to increasing sales figures and office machines had finally transformed into office computers, Siemag was forced to enter cooperation with Philips in order to broaden its spectrum and merge the production site in Eiserfeld into a larger business complex. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has led beach tourism to a complete halt in January 2020, disrupting millions of livelihoods and businesses. Due to the economic importance of beach tourism, many governments reopened tourist beaches after the number of confirmed cases decreased. It is essential to open beaches orderly to meet the needs of tourists, maintain beach's health and restore coastal economy under the new reality. This paper selected Qingdao in China as a case study, drew on a questionnaire survey among beach tourists, summarized the effects of the COVID-19 on beach tourism industry and tourism enterprise, analyzed beach tourists’ psychology and behavior, and developed beach management strategy under the ongoing prevention and control of COVID-19. The results showed that the COVID-19 pandemic caused severe damage to beach tourism which bases on travel and mobility, and this industry was temporarily suspended. With the changing epidemic situation, beach tourism witnessed a gradual recovery from stagnation to local tourism. Meanwhile, tourism enterprises were hit by the devastating impact of the COVID-19, causing problems such as business reduction, tense cash flow, high operating cost and unclear market prospect. Under the normalization of pandemic prevention, tourists did not have severe fear and anxiety about the pandemic, and placed great importance on the prevention and control measures, emergency measures and pandemic risk level of the beach destination. The pandemic also reshaped the perception and mode of beach tourism. Ecological tourism, travelling with family, and local tourism became the primary choices for tourists. Beach congestion, health status, and the quality of tourism services were the biggest concerns for tourists. Additionally, social media and short video APP became the new marketing channels. Finally, beach management strategies were proposed from the aspects of pandemic prevention and control, emergency management, information communication, tourist management, service management, and environmental management. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: Succession of family enterprises has been an issue of concern to a number of researchers, and extensive studies have been conducted on this. Transfer of family business from one generation to next has resulted in collapse of most family business in both developed and developing economies. This study looked at succession in family enterprise in Ghana using theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen, 1991) and cognitive dimension of social capital theory to know the intention of founder/incumbent to hand over the family business to an internal successor. Design/methodology/approach: Our target population for this study is family businesses run in Ghana, Western region. Ghana is not having statistical database on family businesses; therefore, the study relied on the database of registered SMEs which was gotten from Registrar General's Department, Ghana. This is the government department that is in charge of registering business in Ghana. A sample of 596 was used and received a response rate of 60%. The study used structural equation model to find out how the variables correlate to discover the intention of the founder/successor on internal succession. Findings: It was discovered that intention of founder/incumbent to hand over to an internal successor is predominantly determined by attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control and cognitive dimension of the social capital. Trust does not influence the intention of founder/incumbent but attitude; this rejects the findings of most researchers. Research limitations/implications: Most family enterprises were not registered, which made it difficult to reach out to all family businesses. This limited the authors approach to only the registered family enterprises. Practical implications: Family firms are the backbone of any economy, which comprise mostly of SMEs. Therefore, the understanding of succession by incumbents/founders as well as policymakers enhances firms' value and continuity. Originality/value: The study was conducted in Africa, Ghana in particular, owing to the limited studies in this region. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Business families think of their family enterprises as dynamically optimized business portfolios that require new businesses for growth and replacement of existing ones that no longer contribute to the families' visions. This needs to continue adding new businesses makes promoting entrepreneurship among the next-generation family members (NGFE) different. According to the Theory of Planned Behavior, it must begin with the NGFE's intention to pursue entrepreneurship which is more likely to be fostered naturally within the business family. But the NGFEs must be prepared through mentoring to raise their probability of success. Based on the mentorship literature and our own observations, we argue that mentorship must develop the knowledge, skills, and competencies required; help provide exposure and visibility; protect the NGFEs from long-term damages to credibility and trust; boost the NGFEs' social capital by enlarging their network; and establish an arrangement for the NGFEs to release the mental and psychological stresses involved. Ultimately, the family's responsibility toward its members is to help them live a useful and satisfying life which requires the family to go beyond mentoring and nurture. Self-determination theory proposes that nurturing requires satisfaction of the NGFE's psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - Astitva was founded as a not-for-profit organization by Anamika Yaduvanshi, in 2013. The objective of the non-governmental organization (NGO) was to make a visible difference in the lives of disadvantaged sections of the society. Within a short period since its inception, the NGO had positively impacted the lives of individuals and families living in the Wazirpur area. The case helps to understand that even after venturing into vast philanthropic activities, Anamika could not create sustainable livelihoods for the disadvantaged sections of Wazirpur. Is it because of lack of focus on surplus management? The case also helps in understanding the challenges faced by NGOs at ground level. Research questions/Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the nuances of social entrepreneurship. It explores that there should be a balanced approach between social activities that are mostly provided free and generation of surplus to sustain them. The research questions answered are: Has Astitva created a long-term sustainable impact on the lives of marginalized women and children at Wazirpur? Does the business model of Astitva places even stresses on the social activities to engage the participants and generation of financial surplus to sustain the operation? Links to theory: The study is based on the business model canvas of Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010). The model explains that social enterprises should maintain a balance between philanthropy and com-mercial sense to be productive or else their sustainability is at a risk. Phenomenon studied: Anamika started Astitva with an aim of social transformation. She wanted to make a concrete difference in the lives of disadvantaged sections of the society as well as contribute in their integration with the mainstream society. Case context: The case can be discussed from the angle of business model of a sustainable entrepre-neurship and what may go wrong in making a social enterprise successful. Since Anamika had not pre-pared any blueprint of plan of action, she faced several challenges. Findings: An entrepreneur driven by community spirit should not start working without creating a road map of generation of funds to support the social activities.Working model of Astitva is laden with lack of planning and absence of long-term vision that failed to create a sustainable livelihood generation for the marginalized women and children. Discussions: The case provokes students to study the need to start a sustainable social enterprise driven by community spirit to uplift the lives of a marginalized section of women and children. Further, the case challenges students to identify the streams of revenue generation and deployment in a business model of a social enterprise to make it sustainable. © 2021 Birla Institute of Management Technology Reprints and permissions:.

AB  - Family businesses strive not only for economic prosperity but also for social and environmental values and achievements. In an ever-changing business environment, dynamic capabilities are required to sustain performance across these areas. To understand these mechanisms in order to proactively manage them, it is necessary to identify their specific microfoundations and uncover how these relate to sustainability. However, research on sustainability dynamic capabilities in family businesses and their microfoundations is scarce. To address this research gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 German and Swiss family businesses from different industries of different ages and sizes. Our findings suggest that the majority of dynamic capability microfoundations relate to economic sustainability, with a specific focus on future orientation, traditional mindsets, rapid decision-making, intuition, speed, and resource slack. Further, we find the social aspects of innovative mindsets, human capital investments, and participation to be the specific microfoundations that strongly link with social and, eventually, economic sustainability. However, we did not find specific microfoundations for environmental sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This chapter elaborates on the metamorphosis from the traditional family enterprise to the strategically innovative family enterprise. The shift from a traditional understanding of succession to a more innovative way of understanding succession is also addressed in this chapter. Succession is not analysed from a rational, conscious and objective perspective, but rather from an innovative, reflective, open and creative one. The chapter concludes with a recommendation to rethink the widely adopted iceberg analogy used in understanding the perceivable and hidden processes in succession. The strategically innovative thinker in an era of new Renaissance, who places the individual person at the forefront embracing creative ignorance, flips the traditional iceberg bringing all that is not visible to the forefront, placing human beings and the family subsystem at the centre of comprehension and knowledge. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Values in family firms are influenced by the complex interplay of family and business. Thus, research requires methods that grasp this complexity. This paper presents a fresh methodological approach for family business research with the example of an in-depth analysis of CEOs' value orientations. Benefits of an integrated use of two qualitative methods - Q-sorts and narrative interviews - which were collected and analyzed for 16 CEOs of family firms are illustrated. Q-method was used to build value patterns, whereas narrative interviews were conducted to reveal how values were contextualized and interpreted. This integrated approach builds qualitative richness in different ways: first, by allowing for a deep understanding of individual experience; second, by providing more contextual insight, and third, by capturing the meaning of abstract values. The approach advanced here can be reproduced for other complex organizational dynamics. Thus, this user-friendly approach is particularly suited for organizational research in a managerial environment.

AB  - There is an established policy discourse associated with the role of higher education (HE) in supporting the development of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) but far less attention tends to be given to the needs of small family businesses. Given their unique socio-cultural context and the sizeable contribution that family businesses make to society and the economy, this is perhaps surprising. The heterogeneity of family businesses and their preferences for entrepreneurial learning present significant challenges to education providers offering formal courses of study to SMEs. Very few UK university programmes address the knowledge and skills required to start and sustain family businesses and this may be seen to represent a significant market failure in the provision of higher-level learning services to this important sector of the economy. This paper adopts Miller and Seller's (1990) framework that identifies three general educational orientations (transmission, transaction, and transformation) as a theoretical construct to explore the nature of university curriculum and the extent to which it connects with small family firm learning and development interests. This chapter introduces a framework to guide curriculum design influenced by the interests of small family businesses and considers some associated challenges and avenues for further investigation. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Co.

AB  - Context: family involvement creates specific goals that include family interests and values, and is used to pursue the family’s vision, creating effective corporate governance and risk management practices. Objective: our objective is to evaluate the relationship between family influence and enterprise risk management in Brazilian family businesses. Method: data from 142 family businesses was analyzed using descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling. The construct of enterprise risk management comprised: identification, evaluation, response, and communication. Family influence was captured by power, experience, and culture. Results: the results broaden the understanding that, among the three family dimensions investigated, culture is the one that better explains risk management practices. Conclusions: we concluded that the higher the level of family culture, the higher the level of attention to enterprise risk management. © 2021, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

AB  - Under the dual pressure of the new generation of information technology and COVID-19, it has become necessary for family small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to implement management innovation. However, family SMEs seem to be inexperienced and unthought-out in their innovation strategy selection, so that implementing management innovation is like a gamble, with some successes and some failures. Therefore, we consider a uniqueness of family businesses that family members have many opportunities and power to influence innovation activities to investigate how family businesses choose innovation strategies, and then propose a selection model. In order to better capture family member behavior in management innovation, from the perspective of social emotional wealth (SEW), this paper builds this selection model based on evolutionary game theory to analyze the impact of family member behavior on management innovation, and on this basis, introduces the concept of innovation characteristics, thereby increasing the reliability and explanatory validity of the model. Further, this paper analyzes 8 cases in the evolutionary game model through simulation analysis and addresses the question of whether and how family SMEs can successfully implement management innovation, thus providing reference for the selection of innovation strategy of family businesses. This model demonstrates the impact of SEW preferences and innovation characteristics on management innovation, illustrating the evolutionary paths and possible outcomes of innovation practices in different cases. Noteworthily, the proposed selection model can be used to simulate and predict the development and outcome of innovation practices in a real-world situation, and then innovation strategies are carefully selected by inspired managers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We study the political behavior of family firms, the most prevalent corporate structure across the developing world. We argue that family firms are more politically active because their longer time horizons enable them to build and sustain relationships with political actors and to extract benefits from their political investments. Combining previously untapped firm-level information on family ties in publicly listed Brazilian firms with data on corporate campaign contributions, we document that family firms are 15 percentage points more likely to contribute to political campaigns compared to non-family firms — an 82 percent increase. We also find that individuals with family ties in a firm's leadership positions are more likely to make contributions. Contributions by family firms are more persistent over time, indicating that they reflect relationships. Family firms that contribute to campaigns are rewarded with state-subsidized loans, while those that fail to contribute face a penalty, suggesting a dynamic of reciprocity between business and state actors. Finally, we show that the entry of institutional investors has the potential to crowd out family ties within firms. The results provide empirical support to the claims of studies of comparative capitalism, while showing that the equilibria they describe are not necessarily static. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although family-owned businesses have been widely investigated, the question of con-sumers’ perceptions of family firms is still worth more in-depth study. Drawing on the theories of family businesses and consumer behavior, this paper investigates the relationship between the consumers’ perceptions of family-owned enterprises and their purchasing decisions. Using a question-naire, we surveyed 1069 young Polish consumers. Our findings demonstrate that young consumers’ convictions about family businesses are well-formed, despite their quite modest knowledge of these business entities. The vast majority of the survey participants were not able to provide any family business names. This implies that young consumers’ views on family businesses result from specu-lation or adoption of opinions that are dominant in a given society. To raise the level of awareness of their brands and transform consumers’ intentions into real purchasing behavior, family business entities need to intensify the educational significance of their promotional activities to help counteract the stereotypes about family businesses. The analysis presented here has important implications for current debates on whether the development of emotional relationships with family business entities and their brands is a suitable strategy to shape the purchasing attitudes towards the products made by family companies. The research findings could also form the basis for an extended study exploring what strategies family companies can implement in order to effectively shape young consumers’ perceptions about these firms. The research results can also serve as an aid for family firm owners and managers in rebuilding their client-oriented activities. The aforementioned knowledge can support family firm owners and managers in establishing effective marketing strategies. It also opens interesting avenues for further research. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The contribution of the Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SMEs) in every economy is undeniably significant. Still, their existence relies on their leadership’s ability to respond to the continuous challenges utilizing best their limited resources. This paper introduces a Democratic Leadership Change Integration Model (DLCIM) that can be used globally to support and institutionalize SMEs’ innovation by maximizing their human intellectual capital’s effectiveness democratically. Knowledge democratization is a crucial stage in knowledge generation. Its benefits encourage both the employees and the organization to create innovative products and services under ethical management values and principles. The proposed framework helps organizations and SMEs achieve a knowledge-based democratic company-employee relationship. It encapsulates the integration of The Company Democracy Model as the tool and base for innovation, the ADKAR model for change management, and the Self-Determination Theory as a leadership principle. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to comprehensively review previous studies and discover implications for the sustainable growth engines of middle market enterprise (MME) of Korea using meta-analysis. Since Germany’s hidden champion companies are considered as benchmarking targets because their economic environment and size are similar to those of Korean MMEs, a metaanalysis was conducted on the previous studies of them. As a result of integrating the effect sizes of input and output factors according to the process of the Program Logic model from the viewpoint of dynamic capabilities, 198 in Germany and 229 in Korea were derived. It was found that, unlike Korean companies, the number of skilled workers, labor productivity, CEO experience, and Innovation activities within the firm had a significant impact on Germany’s hidden champion companies. In addition, industry and region-oriented innovation networks and family businesses were identified as important variables. Meta-analysis collects a large number of individual studies in order to integrate the results and statistically assess the data. As a result, it will be used as basic data for developing models for academic research in the future. In addition, it will provide implications for sectors in which Korean MMEs should concentrate their efforts in order to create an innovative ecosystem. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Modern pension schemes are based on the delegation of responsibility for pension provision from state institutions to individuals, which implies voluntary retirement saving. Workers for profit (independent workers in household market enterprises) hold much greater personal responsibility for financing their pensions than workers for pay. The main aim of this study was to provide an empirical identification of economic and social factors that would determine the propensity toward long-term saving for pensions by independent, for-profit workers in Poland. Additionally, the study recognizes the level of saving accumulated by them as well as preferred forms in which this saving is made.In order to select determinants of pension saving, a logistic regression model was used. The data come from the direct survey conducted in 2020 by CAWI method (Computer-Assisted Web Interview) on a random nationwide sample of Poles. The analysis of the data also used other methods of descriptive and mathematical statistics. The conducted research showed that the respondents’ individual decisions concerning saving for retirement are affected by such factors as gender, age, family situation, amount of revenue, share of revenue from business activity in total revenue, and subjective assessment of the respondents’ financial situation. The respondents declared holding various, though not high, savings. Moreover, it turned out that independent workers for profit in Poland opt for non-conventional forms of gathering pension savings. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The enterprise risk management (ERM) approach promises to manage corporate risks holistically, as opposed to the silo perspective in traditional risk management frameworks. There is evidence that different economic and regulatory environments profoundly shape the implementation of ERM in different countries. To understand better the specific situation in Germany, this chapter presents an analysis on the current application, the regulatory environment, and the development over time of ERM in Germany. Finally, we highlight some important avenues for further research on ERM in Germany and beyond. © 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - FinTech, the merging of finance and modern Internet-based technology, has rapidly presented itself as a disruptor to traditional business financing, notably in the form of crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending. In this article, we examine the determinants of the use of FinTech finance by businesses, with a particular focus on the ownership, governance, and business practices that may modify the relationships with conventional motivations for external finance. Using a comprehensive sample of Chinese hi-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we find that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and family firms and financially constrained firms are respectively much less and much more likely to seek FinTech finance. In the Chinese context, we argue that part of this may be because of the relative ease with which SOE SMEs can access cheaper conventional finance through SOE banks. The quality of traditional relationship banking also affects the relative desirability of FinTech financing. As for family firms, we find that innovation, as exemplified by R&D activity, effectively overrides any conventional reluctance to access external finance, suggesting the relative benefits of FinTech finance for innovative high-growth firms.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.

AB  - This study takes the three dimensions of CSR, namely, economic (G), social (S), and environmental(E) dimensions, and the three indicators of corporate governance performance, stakeholders and environmental information disclosure, to explore the relationship between family business of CSR and brand value and determine whether the CSR performance of companies in electronic and non-electronic industries has significantly positive effect on brand value. According to the empirical results, regardless of industry, a better CSR performance by a family business has stronger effect on brand value than that of non-family business. Regardless of industry, a better CSR in both electronics and non-electronics companies exerts a significantly positive effect on brand value. A strong tie between family business in an non-electronic industry and the stakeholder contributes to a higher brand value of an enterprise; a higher degree of environmental information disclosure of an electronics family business exerts greater influence on brand value than does a non-electronics family business. © 2021 College of Management, National Cheng Kung University

AB  - Purpose: Family businesses are value-based enterprises, contributing significantly to wealth creation. Although extensive research is conducted on family businesses, there is no study investigating how the cultural traits in the Arab world affect the organizational culture of family businesses. This paper discusses how the cultural characteristics in the Arab world shape family enterprises and explores how the Arab world's organizational culture enables family firms to establish competitive advantage underpinned by founder centrality, the concept of family, and business principles spanning many generations. Design/methodology/approach: A thorough search of the extant literature was done in Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO, and ScienceDirect using a combination of keywords such as Arab culture, family businesses, family firm culture, organizational culture, cultural traits, management strategies, and entrepreneurial strategies. Selected articles were classified according to their content, reviewed, and analyzed. Findings: This study makes a few critical contributions about the nature, and the origins of organizational culture in family firms, entailing the founder's centrality and stewardship theory. Specifically, family firms in the examined region appear to have a stronger firm culture compared to non-family businesses. Also, organizational culture affects family businesses considering the firm-level outcomes, such as hereditary transition success, family inertia, etc. Originality/value: This paper adds to the existing theoretical knowledge and underlines the cultural traits and family firm culture in the Arab world. A framework is presented, offering practical recommendations to managers of family firms striving to advance their competitiveness. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The farm shop is an increasingly proliferate form of farm diversification, both as a single entity or part of a wider strategy encompassing concentric and conglomerate elements. In this context, our paper investigates whether farm shops are viable diversification options in the United Kingdom, by investigating farmer drivers to diversify via shops and consumer motives to purchase there. The research combines data collected from semi-structured interviews (9) with farm shop owners and quantitative consumer surveys (181). The findings show that the primary driver to diversify was identified as an additional income stream. Other factors recognised throughout the interviews were the employment of family members, channels to sell produce and farm location. The reoccurring diversification option linked to farm shops was the addition of a tearoom or cafe. The findings highlight quality of produce and associated presence of attractions as being key to successful diversification. Seasonality of produce, consumer awareness and shop identity are seen as barriers to the enterprise. The research adopts a novel approach by gathering insights into consumer attitudes as well as producer motivations and experiences, and the relationship between them. The research further extends previous analysis by explicitly examining consumer survey evidence on attitudes to direct purchasing of farm products and increases our understanding into farm shop diversifications potential for nurturing entrepreneurship and supporting farm business resilience. The paper raises important implications for farm businesses and policy approaches that might seek to promote an entrepreneurial stance while also extending the analysis. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Purpose: Few studies have focused on the impact of conjugal control and non-conjugal control on the innovation capability of family firms. In the context of the relative lack of research on the relationship between family firm heterogeneity and innovation ability, this study aims to focus on the differentiated impact of husband–wife-controlled family listed companies and non-husband–wife-controlled family listed companies on their innovation capabilities, which provides empirical evidence with more Chinese institutional and cultural characteristics for the development of corporate organizational management and innovation theories. Design/methodology/approach: Taking all A-share listed family firms from 2007 to 2016 as the research sample, this paper examines the influence of spousal control on firm innovation level by empirical research method. Findings: The empirical results show that compared with non-spousal-controlled family enterprises, spousal-controlled family enterprises have significant positive effects on the level of enterprise innovation. Further studies suggest that joint management of spousal-controlled family enterprises improves the level of innovation. Authority difference of the couple will weaken the innovation capacity. However, the wife’s professional skills can promote the innovation level. Originality/value: Focusing on the characteristics of family internal structure and embedding marriage relationship in the enterprise organization, this paper investigates the influence of different characteristics of husband and wife and cooperation mode on enterprise innovation, and the conclusion enriches the theory of family business and family science, as well as provides important information reference for the stakeholder groups in the capital market. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Differential leadership exists widely in family businesses. How to maintain the effective operation of differential leadership by conforming to cultural traditions and shaping people’s psychology and sense of value has become a popular topic in recent years. At the same time, employee zhengchong (striving for a favor) behavior is common in the family enterprises formed by the logic that there are insiders (employees on leaders’ own side) and outsiders (employees not on leaders’ own side) in family enterprises. How to reasonably guide employee zhengchong behavior is very important to the sustainable development of family enterprises. Based on the social comparison theory, this study focuses on exploring the influence of differential leadership on employee zhengchong behavior. Based on the perspective of a complex network, a network evolutionary game model among employees was constructed, and through numerical simulation, it was attempted to explore the key factors affecting the choice of strategies for employee zhengchong behavior in family enterprises. The simulation results show that the degree of partiality of differential leadership has a certain influence on employee zhengchong behavior. For today’s family businesses, moderate partiality is more conducive to the spread of employee zhengchong behavior. In addition, employees’ perception of differential atmosphere has a positive role in promoting favoritism. Leadership plays an important role in the process of employees showing themselves and improving their skills. Therefore, it is of great significance for the sustainable development of the family business to understand how the differential leadership style can effectively promote the positive behavior of employees. This study innovatively uses the complex network theory to reveal the influence of differential leadership on employee zhengchong behavior and confirms that leaders’ moderate partiality and employees’ perception of differential atmosphere can promote employee zhengchong behavior. The research conclusions can provide practical experience for enterprises. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Research Summary: While family small and medium enterprises (SMEs) increasingly involve women in their boards, the role of female directors as catalysts of innovation is yet to be fully understood. Drawing on upper echelons theory, we examine directors' gender in conjunction with family affiliation to investigate the influence of family female directors on family SMEs' innovation. Moreover, by analyzing the contingent role of socioemotional wealth preferences, we open the black box of noneconomic aspects shaping the cognition and behavior of boards. Our analysis of a unique survey-based sample of 287 Belgian family SMEs reveals that family female directors do exert a positive influence on R&D intensity. However, according to the mixed gamble logic, this influence is filtered by the positive and negative moderation of their socioemotional wealth preferences. Managerial Summary: We examine the role that women who are members of the family owning a business play in the decision making of SMEs. Specifically, we investigate the influence that the involvement of family female directors in the board of family SMEs exerts on innovation decisions. To empirically address this line of inquiry, we conducted a survey on 287 Belgian family SMEs. Our analysis shows that the involvement of family female directors in the board fosters family SME's innovation investments. Yet, such an influence is weakened by the intention of the family to retain control over the business but is enhanced by the identification of family members with the firm and by the desire to renew family bonds through dynastic succession. Therefore, our study cautions family SMEs' owners and managers to pay attention to these important dimensions of diversity when appointing directors to their board. © 2022 Strategic Management Society.

AB  - Learning outcomes: This paper aims to enable the application of Value Proposition Canvas and Business Model Canvas to evaluate an opportunity; understand the commonalities and differences between social and commercial enterprises; and recognize the challenges related to the paradox of the social mission and the financial/economic logic. Case overview/synopsis: Neha Arora demonstrated exceptional capabilities of defying the social stigma associated with People with Disabilities (PwDs) to establish Planet Abled, a first in the world venture to provide accessible leisure excursions to PwDs. This entrepreneurial initiative enabling group and solo travel for PwDs as inclusive tourism has created the possibility of social sustainability by bringing change in the lives of PwDs and their family members by ignoring either the insensitive or overprotective societal attitudes and lack of infrastructure concerning travel for PwDs. Its potential growth qualifies for scaling-up, but it can also attract the existing big travel solution providers to enter this domain. Considering these facts, Neha faces multiple dilemmas: How can she sustain and scale up the early momentum created by her enterprise? How can she resolve the challenges related to the paradox of the social mission and the financial/ economic logic while scaling-up Planet Abled?

AB  - Under the background of the government vigorously advocating the development of a mixed-ownership economy, many private enterprises have introduced different types of capital in order to improve their operating status. Based on fixed effects model and threshold model, this paper takes the family companies listed in China's A-shares as samples to study the impact of state-owned equity financing on family business performance and its mechanism. The results show that state-owned equity can not only have a positive impact on performance through its political identity, but also have a negative impact on performance by reducing ownership concentration. Moreover, when state-owned equity financing reduces the ownership concentration of family enterprises to a range of 15.77% to 18.68%, state-owned equity financing will have a significant negative impact on the performance. Therefore, family enterprises should pay attention to the change of ownership concentration when financing state-owned shares, and try to reduce its negative impact on the authoritative governance structure. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - This book documents the distinctive experiences and challenges of Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Asia. By assessing succession and innovation in SMEs as the two sides of a coin, this book explains how innovations are essential to SMEs in succession. With detailed case examples, the book provides generalized solutions for SMEs to answer the question of how to make succession and innovation simultaneously successful. The authors discuss the potential solutions to solve the challenges of SMEs on succession and innovation by considering the utilization of the capital market, the electronic commerce strategy, the international strategy, and angel investment to pursue portfolio entrepreneurship, and compare these Asia solutions to the experiences from Europe. The book is recommended for family business and SME owners, professionals serving these firms, and the consulting firms that work on continuity issues of SMEs in Asia. © Vital Wellspring Education Pte Ltd 2021.

AB  - In recent years, China has actively promoted the green transformation and low-carbon development of agriculture. New-type agricultural business entities such as family farms, specialized cooperatives and agro-processing enterprises have become important vehicles of agricultural green transformation due to their comparative advantages in multiple aspects. Within the agricultural industrialization consortium, the motivation of new-type agricultural business entities to synergistically implement the agricultural green transformation strategy is affected by bounded rationality as well as multiple economic and social factors. Clarifying the mechanism of the above factors would be of benefit to promoting agricultural green transformation in developing countries. In this article, a tripartite evolutionary game model about the production and sale of green agro-products is constructed, and the influences of various factors on the evolutionary game process are analyzed, based on new institutional economics and new economic sociology. According to the simulation results, it is found that the proportional quality contributions of the agents, the intensification of consumers’ preference for green agro-products and the increase of social embedding cost are conducive to the system converging to the favorable evolutionary equilibrium at a faster rate. However, the increases of marginal costs, market risks and spillover effects would prevent the system from converging to the favorable evolutionary equilibrium. Accordingly, corresponding suggestions are put forward to support the effective supply of green agricultural products in the agricultural industrialization consortium. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) with their unique position in the industry as the biggest providers of employment and significant contributors to the gross domestic product (GDP) of the nation, today have greater opportunities for expansion and diversification across industries. As they are poised to grow exponentially, it is important to also study the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) values that these companies embrace. MSMEs, having been largely left unregulated and often being family-owned and managed, are not considered as having strong ethical, environmental, and governance frameworks. As a result, there is a perception of them being unethical. This research article studied some selected organizations in the MSME sector using in-depth interviews and observation techniques. Organizations were examined from five aspects, namely, human value, environmental value, social and relationship values, ethical value, and leadership value. The data collected through observation and open-ended questionnaires were analyzed using the NVivo method of color coding and bucketing. A conceptual model was created based on the five-value constructs. The study concluded that the enterprises have the intention to become ethical and are taking notable actions to create values in their organizations. The study also indicates that there is an increased need for ethics training and awareness creation with regard to the co-creation of values among the players in the MSME sector in India. © Common Ground Research Networks, Shaji Joseph, Asha Nagendra,.

AB  - Entrepreneurs establishing businesses from research and innovation eventually must consider the succession of their firms. Often the enterprise is passed to a family member to continue the vision and legacy of the entrepreneurial founder. While typically the norm of primogeniture dictates that the eldest son is the recipient, today, with changing societal attitudes toward women’s leadership, daughters often find themselves as the firm leader. While some daughters report advantages, others experience significant gender bias in the successor-leader role. Using a critical realist methodology, this exploratory study used interviews from three daughters who were either the successor-leader or were in the process of becoming the successor-leader of a business founded by their father to identify mechanisms within the family, the family business and societal social structures that caused them to experience gender bias. Marxist feminist notions of patriarchy and its roots within the family structure were applied as an a priori theory to identify potential mechanisms that cause gender bias. While this ‘triple patriarchy’ was expected to explain the cause of gender bias, the data suggest that when daughter successors receive validation by their father, any mechanisms that may have caused gender bias are counteracted by others that enable a daughter to be accepted as the successor-leader. © 2021 by Author/s and Licensed by Lectito BV, Netherlands.

The research approach is explorative and qualitative drawing on 31 interviews with wine industry 4.0 experts and managers, mostly owners of SMEs: wineries, wine software and wine machinery enterprises. Resulting findings serve as a roadmap for digital transformation of grape harvest process in SME wineries explaining technologies and work roles necessary for DWT (digital workplace transformation), as well as strategic paths of deployment of novel grape harvest technology. Previous research on the wine industry 4.0 has focused on BMI, while this research expands the focus to include a wider concept of technology adoption strategy as well as DWT. The research identifies two types of factors impacting the strategic deployment of grape harvest technology: pull factors, also termed servitization factors, as well as push factors, termed also digital transformation factors. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This study investigates whether small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) under family influence (FI) can achieve business model innovation (BMI) through dynamic capabilities (DCs) as promoted by prior research. Overall, 259 small and medium-sized family firms in Southeastern China were examined and analysed using the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) method. The findings showed a direct negative link between FI-DCs (sensing, seizing, and transforming capabilities), sensing capabilities - value capture, transforming capabilities - value proposition/value creation, and a positive link between seizing capabilities - value creation. Additionally, the negative moderation effect of environment dynamism was found between sensing capabilities - value capture, seizing capabilities - value creation, and transforming capabilities - value proposition. This research provides various new insights for practitioners and researchers in small and medium-sized family firms to achieve BMI through DCs. It develops an empirical, multi-dimensional hypothetical model from a micro perspective that includes the moderating role of the influencing relationship.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

AB  - This study performed a comparative analysis of changes in the operating status of initial surviving disaster-stricken businesses and non-disaster-stricken businesses in Lushan County, China, after a devastating earthquake on 20 April 2013. It used a logistic regression model to explore the key factors associated with ‘post-disaster continued business operation’ in the long term. Field data were collected from 1,078 businesses and questionnaire data from 263 small businesses between 2013 and 2017. The results indicate that a higher proportion of initial surviving disaster-stricken businesses than non-disaster-stricken businesses managed to remain operational in each observation period. The continued operation of disaster-stricken businesses after the earthquake was positively associated with the owner's age, previous disaster experience, pre-disaster financial conditions, closure duration, and borrowing money from family or friends. A negative association was found with the size of the business. The findings serve as a vital reference for strategies to promote post-disaster continued business operation. © 2019 The Authors Disasters © 2019 Overseas Development Institute

AB  - Although corporate social responsibility (CSR) has attracted increasing attention in recent years, systematic studies on the CSR of Chinese enterprises are absent from academic publications. This study examines the effects of family involvement in the CSR of private enterprises. Using private enterprise data in China, the article reveals that, on the one hand, family involvement will improve CSR investment toward community stakeholders; on the other hand, family involvement has a negative effect on the CSR of contractual stakeholders. With the influence of “chaxu geju,” the author argues that Chinese families tend to shift between different logics of behavior when faced with people with whom they have different types of relationships and incorporate this behavioral mode into company practices when they engage themselves in management and business affairs. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Driven by social development, family enterprises continue to grow in terms of scale and number, becoming an important force that promotes China's economic development, and how to achieve the healthy growth of family enterprises has become an inevitable topic. With the increasingly fierce market competition, more and more family businesses have changed from a single market model to cross-industry operation, trying to seek new growth points through industry diversification. Multiculturalism is the product of a particular era, and it is closely related to the great changes in society in a specific era, including new changes in the fields of family, marriage, religion, education, and race relations and even to the international context. Multiculturalism is a theoretical response to these changes and represents the current cultural research tendencies of the international academic community. Socio-emotional wealth and an innovative environment are particularly important for family businesses in a multicultural context. The article first introduces the social emotional wealth and the innovation investment of family enterprises, then focuses on the impact of the innovation environment on the innovation investment of family enterprises, and analyzes the influence mechanism of social emotional wealth and innovation environment on family innovation investment, so as to put forward corresponding countermeasures and suggestions, which also has certain guiding significance for the innovation management and practice of Chinese family enterprises.  © 2022 Hui Liu.

AB  - Previous studies on the internationalization of family-owned small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have emphasized governance factors or national-level institutions but have largely neglected the critical role of community institutional contexts and their interactions with intrafamily knowledge resources. We argue that community family logic shapes the socioemotional wealth pursuits of family SMEs and drives them to avoid internationalization and that superior knowledge resources in families could moderate this relationship. The empirical results, which are based on a sample of 3439 Chinese family SMEs, support our hypothesis. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - After more than 40 years of opening the door to the outside world, Chinese family firms have developed rapidly, but also caused the problem of serious environmental pollution. The solution to the problem stems inevitably from the innovation in environmental protection technology. This means the environmental investment of family firms determines whether the enterprise can maintain sustainable development. However, Chinese family firms have been going through a critical period of intergenerational succession. This study aims to use the data of Chinese Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed family firms from 2013 to 2020 to study the relationship between intergenerational succession of family enterprises and environmental protection investment. We also examine the moderating role of the two different types of external environment–the government and the market. The regression results of the Tobit model of the full sample and subsample show that succession has a significant positive impact on family business environmental investment, and this impact is more significant in companies whose successors have overseas experience. Environmental regulation will strengthen the positive impact of succession on corporate environmental investment, while market competition will weaken it. Based on the findings, we also discuss policy recommendations. These findings are of great significance to the green and sustainable development of family firms. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - German Mittelstand firms are part of an institutional setting characterized by tightly knit relationships with internal and external stakeholders, which makes it more difficult for these firms to engage in business model innovation. The topic of how these firms have remained competitive over time has attracted growing interest from researchers. Therefore, this study investigates how dynamic capabilities can promote business model innovation for a sample of SMEs from the German Mittelstand (n = 285) and tests whether the different characteristics of these firms moderate this relationship. We find that specific dynamic capabilities are needed for the various aspects of business model innovation. Medium-sized firms profit from higher engagement with outside stakeholders, while balancing efficiency and flexibility, and small firms are advised to concentrate on revising their resource configurations. Moreover, we identify whether the innovativeness of Mittelstand firms is rooted in their individual characteristics or is a function of this institutional setting. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - China's late Chairman Mao Zedong once said "Women hold up half the world", but in several respects the full emancipation of women still remains a global challenge. This book, based on extensive empirical studies on Chinese female leaders in different fields, develops a "female professional status attainment theory". It summarizes the conditions for Chinese women to become leaders in various professions as the following: increased human, economic and social capital; gender equality awareness; gender-friendly environment; and improved work-life-balance. The book also proposes supporting policies for the development of high-level female talents female leaders in three different sectors: women in politics, in professional fields, and in enterprise management. With the comprehensive perspectives of female leaders' development that addresses women's unique needs in organizations, this book is a good choice for researchers and readers who are interested in China's top-level talent development, gender equality and women's professional attainment. © Economic Science Press 2021.

AB  - Social involvement of enterprises, i.e., sharing wealth with those in need, can be spoken of only in the case of owner-managed family firms (FB). These companies account for two-thirds of all enterprises in the global economy; they contribute to the stability, development, and continuity of the existence of the economies of many countries. However, the sustainability of the existence of individual FBs is often threatened. Social engagement of owners and preparation of successors are the appropriate retort as they affect the transgenerational sustainability of these enterprises. The purpose of this study is to identify the causes, scope, forms, and beneficiaries of social engagement of Polish FBs. The study uses the Delphi method implemented in three stages: (1) selection of experts; (2) collection of information; and (3) development and interpretation of research results in the context of adopted research questions, research objective, and research hypothesis. The results of the study confirm that FBs make an important contribution to sustainable social development at the micro level. The social engagement of FBs brings benefits to both beneficiaries and donors, responds to genuinely existing needs, and supports the cross-generational sustainability of companies. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - Theoretical basis: The case delves into supply, demand, price gouging, hoarding and capabilities of the firm. The theories/concepts and a short overview are covered below. These theories and concepts are then referenced as appropriate in the “Answers to Discussion Questions” section as follows: Supply Demand Theory; Price Gouging, Speculation and Hoarding; Resources, Capabilities and Activities; Friedman’s and Porter’s view of goals of a firm; Corporate Social Responsibility. Research methodology: The case was motivated after a discussion with Mr Matthew Roberts, who is the Chief Operating Officer of SPR Industries. Several subsequent interviews were conducted with Matt. Matt also became the chief protagonist of the case. Matt provided multiple quotes and anecdotes. The protagonist Matt and the focal organization (SPR Industries) are disguised. The financial figures have also been disguised using a multiplier. However, the material facts of the case are authentic. Case overview/synopsis: This case sheds light on the impact of the COVID pandemic on a small business in the personal protective equipment industry. The students will get an understanding of the supply and demand forces in a market. Furthermore, the case bears out how unpredictable situations such as the pandemic lead to speculation and price gouging opportunities but not in all products affected by it. The case explores the corporate social responsibility (CSR) of firms regarding price gouging in their products. Students will also get an appreciation of how an industry and its participants change in response to such black swan events as the COVID pandemic. Finally, the case presents a small enterprise’s decision choices Ã¢?? Should they maintain the status quo, become a sub-broker or become a wholesaler. Complexity academic level: This case is designed to target undergraduate students of strategic management or entrepreneurship. It could be appropriate for upper level courses such as Strategic Management, Small Business Management and maybe even Family Business Management. It could be taught in the latter half of the course after the basic concepts have been covered. This case could bring together many of the concepts into a real-life setting. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to explore the entrepreneurial journey of select women entrepreneurs from South India to provide qualitative insights into the factors influencing their career choice (to become and continue as an entrepreneur) and to identify the drivers of their growth and well-being. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather data from 35 women entrepreneurs in the micro, small and medium enterprises sectors of Tamil Nadu, India. Data were content analyzed using NVivo 12. Findings: Qualitative content analysis identified three broad themes and several sub-themes to suggest a conceptual framework reflecting the possible relationships among them. Women entrepreneurs’ career choice, the growth of their ventures and their well-being were found to be significantly driven by a blend of personal attributes, strong family support and institutional support. Practical implications: The findings will help the government to provide appropriate institutional support with customized initiatives and incentives to encourage women-owned tiny and small businesses to grow faster. Appropriate personality development programs and skills training will aid their growth. Originality/value: This study contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by providing real-life insights from women entrepreneurs from an emerging economy context, especially from Tamil Nadu, which has the highest number of women entrepreneurs in India. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - We investigate the productivity of family owned small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Specifically, we examine whether productivity is influenced by the number of family owners and by family member involvement in daily operations. We find that the productivity of family firms is non-monotonically associated with the number of family owners and with the number of family members who work in the firm. Although prior empirical research has often been associated with positive effects, we identify problematic cases, especially when a few owners are involved. We document a negative effect on productivity if the firm has few but more than one family owner, and if the firm has two or three owners who are involved in daily business operations. In these cases, an external (non-family) Chair (CEO) might mitigate these effects stemming from the family ownership (family working in the firm). The results of our study have practical relevance and policy implications when it comes to questions concerning optimal governance. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Women entrepreneurship has attracted the attention of academics and practitioners with a large body of research studies in recent years. Past literature reviews on women entrepreneurship have been criticized for their limited scope, lack of interdisciplinary perspective, and the need for more objective, technology-facilitated analytical methods. Our study provides insights into the development of women entrepreneurship research, including a new analysis through the lens of sustainable development and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bibliometric indicators and a systematic literature review approach are used to analyze literature published between 1991 and 2021 to better map the development of research and related opportunities for enhancing studies on women entrepreneurship. In addition to traditional bibliometric indicators such as publications, citations, etc., we used altmetrics, a new metric to assess the engagement and impact of publications based on social media presence. The Dimensions database has been used to assemble and arrange 3157 publications on women entrepreneurship, of which 843 publications are directly aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and 80 publications related to COVID-19. Our findings indicate that the top three SDG of interest to researchers are: SDG 8, decent work and economic growth; SDG 10, reducing inequalities; and SDG 5, gender equality. Within each SDG, we find concentrated studies on themes relating to the socio-political and small-medium enterprises, including family business management and gender biases, and their implications for sustainable development. Further, studies on the impact of COVID-19 reveal a significant bias towards women’s empowerment in ICT, digitization, and e-commerce while exposing the need for gender-moderated policies and governmental interventions. We offer suggestions for future studies on enabling and measuring the contributions of women’s entrepreneurship to sustainable development, including capital investments and the long-term impacts of the pandemic on women-led enterprises. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Due to the aging of business owners, business succession of small and medium-sized enterprises and family business enterprises has become a social issue. Business succession not only inherits tradition, but also provides an opportunity to realize second founding and innovation by demonstrating entrepreneurship. If the comprehensive management resources of the previous generation can be smoothly passed on to the next generation through business succession, it will be possible to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society and SDGs. In this study, we conducted a literature survey and consideration of each process of the entrepreneurial activity process of business succession, targeting the case of business succession to a third party(unrelated person) through the increasing number of small M & A in Japan. As a result of consideration, the following possibilities were obtained. As a successor manager, third-party working practitioners (middle management, managers, etc.) outside the same family can demonstrate their abilities, and business succession by an outside third party can be smoothly realized. In the discussion, in each entrepreneurial activity process, the viewpoint of business administration, the ability of third-party working practitioners (middle management, managers, etc.) outside the family, the candidates for originality in Japan not found in other countries, the candidates for originality in unrelated person not found in the family were considered. © 2022 PICMET.

It discusses the nature of family money, how this can present both competitive edges and burdens, and how rising-generation ventures should combine family and market capitals to drive longer-term growth in different stages. It explains how families can orchestrate resources for new ventures through the use of business plans, family banks and family investment funds. It examines a few family-owned MSMEs in Hong Kong, to contextualize how families nurture and finance transgenerational entrepreneurship. © Vital Wellspring Education Pte Ltd 2021.

AB  - Farmers are increasingly required to become more productive and innovative to ensure effective management of farm resources and to improve their livelihoods. Farm diversification has been identified as a viable strategy that can be adopted by farm businesses to achieve these objectives in order to reduce their reliance on agricultural production as the main source of household income. In this study, we employ a mixed methods approach to analyse the factors influencing farm diversification and diversification strategies in Northern Ireland. The challenges of setting up a farm diversification enterprise were also explored. Data collection and analysis were undertaken by combining both quantitative and qualitative approaches in a two-stage process using primary data obtained from a survey of farm businesses and interviews with key stakeholders involved in the Northern Ireland agricultural sector. The study results show that the primary motivating factor in pursuing farm-level diversification is the need to generate additional income. The analysis has shown that farm level diversification has the capacity to contribute to both the sustainability of family farms and the wider rural economy. The study results support the need for governments to explore the development of policy measures to support diversification at farm level. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - With the continuous development of business process management technology,different users in large enterprises may modify the same business process, so business process variants often change with the change of business requirements. To further manage the business process family,a change propagation mechanism that could propagate the change operations imposed on the process variant to the configurable process model was needed,which was focused on the method to effective complete the change propagation and co-evolution of the process variant and the configurable model. The mapping relationship between process variants and configurable models should be standardized, a series of change operations should be further defined to achieve synchronous mapping of changes on variants to configurable models,and a clean operation was then applied to remove the illegal parts of the propagated model. Through the experiments on the SAP EPC reference business process data set,the feasibility and universality of the proposed process change propagation method were proved. © 2022 CIMS.

AB  - Purpose: Among all forms of commitment, affective commitment has been shown to be the most desirable for enterprises. However, research on commitment among employees in family-run businesses in the hospitality industry is scant. To address this gap, this study aims to analyze the impact of employer image components on hospitality employees’ affective occupational commitment within family-run businesses. As one can assume specific employer image aspects when studying family-run businesses, this paper expects to achieve a better understanding of the relationship between employer image and employee commitment in this context. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts the employer image framework of Baum and Kabst (2013), emphasizing that in addition to considering potential employees, the commitment of current employees needs to be assessed. Convenience sampling is used to obtain a sample from the target population (Tyrolean hospitality and gastronomy employees) from June to September 2018. Multiple linear regression analysis is applied to test the influence of individual employer image constituents on employees’ affective occupational commitment. Findings: Among the five components of the employer image framework applied here, working atmosphere, task attractiveness and payment attractiveness show a significant influence on employees’ affective occupational commitment. Originality/value: This study connects an existing employer image model to employee commitment within the hospitality industry. The findings suggest that the model is applicable to current employees as a key stakeholder group and shows the utility of employer image theory in connection with employee commitment. © 2021, Katrin Schwaiger and Anita Zehrer.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of international migration experience on entrepreneurship in sending areas. To identify prosperous businesses that create jobs and encourage economic development, this study isolates businesses other than street-vending enterprises with non-family employees. Retrospective life history data from the Mexican Migration Project (N = 11,789 persons & 146,372 person-years) was used to estimate the annual probability of becoming an entrepreneur across 170 Mexican communities between 1975 and 2017. This study found that (1) any prior migration experience increases the probability of entrepreneurial entry relative to non-migrants; (2) accumulated months of migration experience are positively associated with the probability of entrepreneurial entry; (3) undocumented status is associated with a lower probability of entrepreneurial entry. The positive effect of accumulated migration experience on entrepreneurship suggests that international migrants can accumulate human and financial resources that are essential to early stage entrepreneurship. Thus, entrepreneurship represents an important pathway through which international migration can encourage economic development in less developed regions. At the same time, the results suggest that that immigration policies in receiving countries can undercut migrants’ capacities to mobilize resources and contribute to economic development upon return. These findings suggest that target migration creates a win–win by addressing labor shortages in receiving countries, while transferring resources to sending areas that enable economic mobility and development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In most studies, the affiliation of the manager (family‐affiliated or non‐family affiliated) and supposedly related behavior (agent or steward) is considered the sole antecedent to explain a family business’ (non) professionalization of managerial controls. This paper, based on Luhmann’s new system theory, examines whether a family’s decision premises influence the design of managerial controls in family firms in addition to a manager’s family affiliation status. Using survey data of 135 large and medium‐sized Brazilian family firms and testing the hypotheses with SEM, this study provides evidence that a family’s decision premises significantly influence the design of managerial controls in family firms. This study provides evidence that when a family’s intention to transfer the firm to next generation (TGO) is high, more formal controls, as well as controls of a more participative nature are adopted in a family firm. Moreover, the results do not indicate that the level of family involvement in management affects the design of controls in firms with high TGO. The results only showed a significant relationship between a family’s intention to control and influence (FCI) the firm and the absence of participative controls. In addition, these findings also illustrate that each single family‐induced decision premise has the potential to explain family firm behavior, since each of the two premises considered in our study is related to a different design of the controls adopted by the family firm. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: Little is known regarding triggers in the adoption of governance practices within family businesses. Enterprises can implement governance practices to avoid re-arising conflicts lived in the past. Moreover, the type of conflicts experienced can determine the order in which different types of governance practices are adopted, another issue that requires further investigation. To address these knowledge gaps, this study gathers evidence into how the adoption of governance practices is linked to the conflicts experienced in family businesses and how this adoption evolves. Design/methodology/approach: A multiple case study was conducted with 15 family businesses in the agricultural sector. The conflicts experienced throughout the enterprises' trajectories and the governance practices adopted were analysed and classified according to their relationship with the family, business and ownership subsystems. Findings: The study shows that there is no direct link between the conflicts experienced and the governance practices adopted in family businesses. The most recurrent conflicts have to do with the relationship between family and ownership; however, the adoption of governance practices is centred on the relationship between business and ownership. The practices that mediate the relationship between family and business are adopted second, and the practices that mediate the relationship between family and ownership are adopted last. Originality/value: The study applies a classification of conflicts and governance practices that adjusts to the complexity of the family business. The research contributes to the field by providing an understanding of the integration of knowledge about the family business, governance systems and conflict. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Both Hungary and Germany belong to the old-world wine-producing countries and have long winemaking traditions. This paper aims at exploring and comparing online branding strategies of family SME (small and medium sized enterprises) wineries at Lake Balaton (Hungary) and Lake Constance (Germany), as two wine regions with similar geographic characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: This paper, based on a total sample of 37 family wineries, 15 at Lake Balaton and 22 at Lake Constance, investigates the differences in brand identity on the website, brand image in social media and online communication channels deployed in both wine regions. The study applies a qualitative methodology using MaxQDA software for conducting content analysis of texts in websites and social media. Descriptive statistics and t-test were conducted to compare the usage of different communication channels and determine statistical significance. Findings: At Lake Balaton, the vineyard, the winery and the family, while at Lake Constance, the lake itself and the grape are highlighted regarding family winery brand identity. The customer-based brand image of Hungarian family wineries emphasizes wine, food and service, with the predominant use of Facebook. In the German family wineries, the focus of brand identity is on wine, friendliness and taste and includes more extensive usage of websites. Originality/value: The paper deploys a novel methodology, both in terms of tools used as well as geographic focus to uncover online branding patterns of family wineries, thereby providing implications for wine and tourism industries at lake regions. It compares the share of selected most-used words in the overall text in websites and in social media, and presents the key findings from this innovative approach. © 2022, Ivan Paunovic, Nóra Obermayer and Edit Kovari.

AB  - Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play an essential economic role through income and employment generation as well as reducing inequalities. In this regard, continuous innovation is a pillar for guaranteeing SMEs’ survival worldwide. In Brazil, the ALI Program (Portuguese acronym for Local Innovation Agent) trains groups of SMEs to implement a continuous innovation process based on agile methodologies. This paper applied focus group methodology to investigate whether, after participating in the program, SMEs practice some innovation processes in their business and the difficulties perceived by entrepreneurs in incorporating innovation processes into their ventures. Based on the extant literature and on the focus group, it was observed that SMEs see innovation as a risk, fear innovating because of tradition, family, and/or generational context, and do not see innovation as a process suitable to be systematized with agile tools. In addition, factors such as the age of the SMEs’ leaders, the age of the SMEs, the gender of the SMEs’ leaders, and the nature of the SMEs (family business or not) may affect their openness to innovation. Recommendations are stated for practitioners (such as ALIs) to improve their training quality, policymakers to improve and create similar programs, and researchers interested in future research directions. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In the post-pandemic era, it will become normal for family enterprises to seek innovative development. They have become more committed to building socially responsible companies and are more willing to actively promote corporate values in order to create long-term benefits. Therefore, this paper uses listed family companies entering the intergenerational succession period from 2018 to 2020 as the research object and empirically tests the influence of family involvement on firm performance, as well as the moderating effects of family members’ overseas experiences and family firm’s charitable donation behaviors. The results show that the ownership and management involvement of family members can significantly improve the performance of family enterprises. The overseas experience of family members has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between the two, while the charitable giving behavior of family enterprises has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between the two. The above research provides countermeasures and reference for family enterprises to realize the family business and the lasting development in the process of intergenerational inheritance, upgrading, and transformation. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Digital technology is shocking the whole industries in the world. It is significant to sustain a trans-generational entrepreneurship by building shared values between families in a digital age, sustaining the value of constant entrepreneurship, and showing values through sustainability. In this article, we will introduce two cases to illustrate how digital transformation process is implemented by these two SMEs with different innovation strategic positions. One is a traditional screw manufacturing enterprise which innovate in the original industry. The other one is a small business which applies the communication technology to enter a new market. This article has significantly value for understanding how the family entrepreneurship is sustained and created during the digital transformation process. © Vital Wellspring Education Pte Ltd 2021.

AB  - Emerging countries and traditional industries may not be ready for direct migration of Industry 4.0. In particular, the broiler is a major source for meat, while poultry farming in emerging countries is mainly by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or family businesses. The live broilers need to maintain the desired specification for food processing while optimizing the feeding conversion rate for revenue management. Conventionally, broiler growth monitoring and prediction rely on farmers’ experience and a small amount of data by unrigorous sampling. Although the automatic weighing system (AWS) has gradually been employed to replace manual weighing to reduce cost and casualties, existing automatic weighing systems have limited capability for weight monitoring and weight prediction of broiler future growth. To fill the gaps, this study aims to employ Industry 3.5 as a hybrid and develop a data-driven framework for weight monitoring and prediction to support smart production for poultry farming for revenue optimization. The proposed framework contains two modules. The weight monitoring integrates Gaussian Mixture Model, bootstrapping resampling, and weighted mean technique to estimate the current weight of live broilers in the farm via big data including electronic signals collected from the farms via multiple sensors and devices. The weight prediction module employs mathematical growth functions as a basis and daily feedback for adjustment to provide real-time weight prediction to support related decisions for smart production. An empirical study was conducted in Taiwan. The results have shown the practical viability of this approach. The developed solution is implemented in the broiler industry. © 2020

AB  - Despite recent large flows of migrants to the UK, the gendered nature of how men and women experience migrant entrepreneurial journeys remains under-researched. This article contributes to debates within the field of entrepreneurship by exploring the lived experiences of transnational migrant entrepreneurs setting up enterprises in the UK. Reporting the findings of interviews with forty-seven Eastern European transnational migrant entrepreneurs, this article focuses on the rarely discussed form of symbolic capital understood as the prestige, status and positive reputation individuals possess in the eyes of others. Our findings demonstrate the multifaceted and often gendered nature of forms of cultivated symbolic capital. Men use traditional conceptions of ‘status’ and ‘prestige’ to accrue forms of symbolic capital, which consequently facilitate and legitimate the transfer of economic capital into their UK businesses. In contrast, women, by setting up successful businesses in the UK, gain legitimacy in the eyes of family and friends in their home countries. This in turn enables them to overcome traditional gendered ascribed roles in which their visibility is centred solely around looking after children and the family. The article concludes by reflecting on the contributions and implications for theory and practice before identifying directions for further research. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - What does it mean for a private enterprise in China to be embedded in a family? Our purpose here is twofold: (1) use social network analysis to describe what it means for a firm to be embedded in a family, (2) reveal from the application a new kind of firm, not family, yet akin to family. Armed with data on a large probability sample of private enterprises — a third of which meet ownership and employment criteria of being family businesses — we uncover a category of “hybrid family firms” that look modern in the style of firms that exclude family, but operate socially in ways similar to family firms. Our conclusion from summary statistics on the sample is that there are no differences in average performance level or network advantage for the three categories of businesses: family firms, hybrid family firms, and family-excluded firms. The fact that CEOs of family firms and hybrid family firms more often turn to family as key business contacts is a fact about network composition that raises no question about network mechanisms. Whether the CEO turns to more or fewer family contacts, government help is more likely with stronger political connections, and business success and survival are more likely with a large, open network. That said, the look-modern, act-traditional hybrid family firms stand alone in prospering with a CEO embedded in a closed business network. Recognition of hybrid family firms adds to the literature's illustrations of social network analysis used to distinguish types of businesses and business people, and extends the population of organizations within which governance and strategy are likely to be better understood when viewed through a family logic. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Director rotation mechanism can effectively solve the problem of control of family business and enhance dynamic capabilities. This paper selects the case of TaiLi, which lasted for nearly 40 years, as the object of study, and develops the theoretical basis for the alternation between turn-taking mechanism and inter-family business. The research shows that the rotation mechanism facilitates a peaceful corporate climate for family businesses, where managers can expand, share, transfer and innovate knowledge through rotation. The family business upgrades the mechanism of turning around and continuously enhances a series of dynamic capacities such as internal learning ability, resource integration ability and environmental adaptation ability, achieves intergenerational growth of family-owned businesses through the continuous emergence of heterogeneous resources. This paper establishes an analytical paradigm of turning around family business and enterprise dynamic capabilities, which can provide practical implications for the sustainable and healthy development of family businesses and managers' knowledge innovation.  © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this article is to develop new insights into the interplay between trust, indigenous institutions and weak/dysfunctional formal institutions using the Nigerian context – a developing country in Western Africa. It advances new understanding on how Nigerian entrepreneurs trust in their indigenous institutions such as family ties, kinship, chieftaincy, religion, cooperatives and trade associations to resolve disputes arising from their exporting activities as opposed to dormant formal institutions in their country. Design/methodology/approach: This exploratory study adopts an interpretive research paradigm, and it utilises a case study strategy. Data collected through observations, archival records and qualitative conversations with 36 exporting Nigerian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is analysed by utilising a combination of within and cross-case analysis techniques. Doing so enabled an in-depth study of the methods their owner-managers use in order to take advantage of the relationships they established through their long-standing cultural institutions in the place of weak formal institutions in their country. Findings: Indigenous institutions have evolved to replace formalised institutions within the business environment in Nigeria. They have developed to become an alternative and trusted arbiter for solving SMEs' export issues because of weak/dysfunctional formal institutions in the Western African country. The owner-managers of exporting SMEs perceive formal institutions as representing a fragmented system that does not benefit their export businesses. Practical implications: The findings demonstrate that there is need for policymakers to consider the role of informal institutions in the Nigerian context. Such an approach is essential given the economic importance and increasing number of SMEs that trade and export their goods through informal structures in Nigeria. Originality/value: The study indicates that it is not just the void or absence of institutions that exist in a developing country such as Nigeria, but weak/dysfunctional formal institutions have been replaced by culturally embedded informal institutions. Thus, the study provides a new theoretical avenue depicting the concept of trusting in indigenous institutions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Having studying myself abroad at Harvard Business School, I want to use the lens of the disruptive innovation to study the case of an Italian family business (Livi srl), operating in the sector of food and beverage (pasta), which has to cope with the crisis pushed by the pandemic. I want to use the concept of the disruptive innovation to understand: How strongly the customers behaviour has been changing in the sector of food and beverage because of Covid 19 in term of functional, emotional and social jobs to be done Whether the disruptive strategy could be a useful business map for the Small Medium Enterprises to re-adapt their profit formula, resources and processes How the local authorities could help the SMEs to leverage the production at a local dimension This paper uses a method based on a case history of an Italian family business, which has been operating for 50 years at a local dimension in the sector of food and beverage. The pandemic has significantly changed the customers’ habits and their needs and this put the lights on the big amount of jobs to be done by the companies to meet these incoming customers’ requirements. Indeed, in the sector of food and beverage many restaurants were forced to close because of the decision making taken by the local authorities. Would Livi srl be able to cope with this economic downturn? Which strategy should the entrepreneur set up to go through this negative financial performance? I want to answer to these questions by using the lens of theory of the Disruptive Strategy taught by Prof. Clayton at Harvard Business School. This paper puts the lights on the business’ ability to adapt its deliberate strategy to the new challenges of the market; indeed, a strong actual strategy is a good mix of a deliberate strategy with an emergent strategy. Finally, the relationship between local authorities (policy) and companies is investigated in a critical way, by which that has studied in term of partnership through the cost benefit analysis rather than considering the policy a social tool able to meet the customers’ needs with the business supply. © 2021, Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

AB  - We replicate, in the Chinese context, a study undertaken in 2007 by Miller, Le Breton-Miller, Lester, and Cannella (MLLC), which examined the performance differences among lone-founder firms, family firms, and nonfamily firms in the U.S. Our goal was to test the generalizability of MLLC's findings, as well as uncover contextual nuances that might exist in a markedly different institutional context that also includes state-owned enterprises. Our results corroborate MLLC's finding that lone-founder firms outperform other types of firms. We also find that when family ownership is at lower levels, family firms and nonfamily firms seem to have similar performance; however, family firms have a performance advantage at higher levels of family ownership. Finally, we find that state-owned enterprises are outperformed by lone-founder, family and nonfamily firms. Our study highlights the importance of distinguishing among different types of nonfamily firms, between family and lone-founder firms, and among family firms with different levels of family ownership. We discuss the implications of our findings and offer suggestions for future research in family business. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A clan is a group of families that are linked by patriarchal blood relationships with one common ancestor. Clans may help members to find jobs and set up businesses through blood-based networks, but traditional male-biased norms may lead to different effects on employment between genders. This paper examines the causal effects of clans on the employment statuses of men and women and the gap in the effects between genders. To mitigate the endogeneity issue, we employ the potential rain-fed rice yield as an instrumental variable to obtain consistent estimates. We find that clans have positive effects on women's probabilities of participating in the labor market and having nonfarming jobs, while the effects on men are not significant. Clans have positive effects on male entrepreneurship but no effects on female entrepreneurship. The results are robust to a host of sensitivity tests. Moreover, we find that the findings are driven mainly by small cities, and clans have larger effects on regions where private enterprises dominate. The dynamic analysis indicates that the gender gap of clan effects decreases with the development of urbanization and marketization. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Purpose: Previous studies have largely examined interregional variations of small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) rather than family firm concentrations. This paper aims to address this gap through an analysis of firm type indicators across Europe from the Eurostat database, using social, economic and demographic statistics at the NUTS 2 regional level to ascertain the nature, prevalence and regional contexts of family firm concentrations. Design/methodology/approach: Hierarchical clustering is performed to map the regional distribution of the European family business. Findings: Results show that the co-existence of family SMEs with large firms is negatively related to regional economic performance, and this variation has implications for the understanding of the survival and strategic behaviour of family firms. Originality/value: The study promotes a new family business “in context” than “by context” point of view and paves the way for further empirical work with interregional family business data at various spatial levels. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper investigates the influence effects of government subsidies on the innovation of family-owned enterprises in China through a panel data model and Heckman two-stage model, and explores the possible influence mechanisms of government subsidies on different innovation behaviors of family-owned enterprises through a mediation analysis method. It is found that government subsidies play a significant role in promoting innovation input, innovation quantity and innovation quality of family-owned enterprises. From the perspective of innovation quality, government subsidies are more beneficial to family-owned enterprises without “two jobs in one” or “2nd generation succession”. Compared with family-owned enterprises that have completed intergenerational inheritance, government subsidies are more conducive to enhancing the innovation quantity of family-owned enterprises that have not achieved “2nd generation succession”. We find also that government subsidies can indirectly improve the innovation quality of family-owned enterprises by increasing the proportion of state-owned shares and easing the financing constraints. By organically integrating two relatively independent research fields (effectiveness of government subsidy and innovation of family businesses), this paper opens up a new way of thinking for exploring the sustainability of family businesses. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Learning outcomes: At the macro level, the case study enables the students to appreciate the complexity emerging market economies face in achieving economic development and environmental sustainability without comprising each other. The students understand the importance of behavioural change and empowerment of communities in projects dealing with transformational social changes. Theoretically, the students learn about the change mechanisms and organisational practices market-based organisations install to drive their positive social change (PSC) projects. At the micro level, students learn about the process of setting up Mangalajodi Ecotourism Trust (MET) – that not only enthused the local community economically but also instilled it with awareness and motivation towards sustaining its ecosystem. Analytically, at macro level, it assists the students to have a lens of PSC framework to examine corporate social responsibility, social entrepreneurship and BoP strategies of market-based organisations to affect social change. Application/problem solving: The case study explains to the students how the PSC levers of motivation, capability and opportunity structures were applied by NatWest Bank during different phases of project execution. As management grapples with new problems, the students are encouraged to use the levers to recommend an action plan. It allows students to apply SWOT and think of competitive strategies for MET. It allows students to think of strategies that may apply for a better management of Ecotourism at Mangalajodi. Case overview/synopsis: As part of its broader commitment to sustainable development and climate change action, the NatWest Group (formerly Royal Bank of Scotland Group) launched its Supporting Enterprise Programme in India in the year 2007. The project aimed at creating income-generating opportunities for indigenous and economically vulnerable sections of society living in critical natural ecosystems. The project was under the leadership of N. Sunil Kumar, a zealous nature lover, with over two decades of experience in business strategy and public affairs and a specialty in environmental sustainability. He headed Sustainable Banking at NatWest and was head of NatWest Foundation-India. The Mangalajodi project shared the problems many of NatWest’s other projects in India presented. Poor communities that relied solely on natural resources for their sustenance slid deeper into poverty as ecosystems degraded. Lacking alternative sources of livelihood and facing scantier resources, the communities helplessly caused additional damage to weak ecosystems when they drew on the resources even more vigorously. Poaching of migratory birds for supplemental income was a huge problem at Mangalajodi; it was not only rapidly altering the ecosystem to sustain the birds but also deteriorating and weakening its ecology as a whole. Measures to eliminate poaching were failing in the absence of alternate means of livelihoods and a strong incentive to protect the birds. MET was established under the project in 2009. A decade later, it had become a resounding success. A community-owned and run enterprise, MET was providing direct employment to over 100 poorest families at the tiny village and creating income-generating opportunities and entrepreneurial ventures for many others. Poaching was practically negligible at Mangalajodi, and the community was drawing huge admiration for its role in conserving the ecosystem. However, the progress of Mangalajodi Ecotourism was paradoxical, on the one hand; its popularity was rising but, on the other hand, it was becoming overcrowded and looked ill managed. Its rising commercial value was bringing in more land developers, builders and investors, but permanent concrete structures were also coming up quite unscrupulously. There were many challenges – how should growth of ecotourism at Mangalajodi be managed? What mechanisms and practices ensured that the community was empowered enough to participate in decisions of land use, infrastructure, energy and waste management at Mangalajodi? How should MET become more competitive and innovative to grow despite future challenges? Complexity academic level: The case study is useful for students of Management at Under Graduate and Post Graduate Levels for understanding the following: the sustainability of fragile ecosystems; the community at the intersection of sustainable development and natural resources conservation and protection of biodiversity; knowing in detail about the planning, implementation and management of ecotourism projects; and decisions regarding community-based ecotourism projects.

AB  - Researchers have grown increasingly concerned with whether state-owned capital can help private enterprises (often family businesses) achieve long-term and stable development under mixed ownership reform in China. Chinese listed family firms from 2013–2019 are taken as the research sample to investigate the influence of state-owned capital participation on the innovation activities of family businesses. State-owned equity participation appears to promote innovation in private enterprises with a nearly linear trend. This observation also passes a robustness test. This work reveals the importance of state-owned equity in terms of strategic decision-making for private enterprises, as well as managerial insights regarding the sustainable and healthy development of family businesses. The results also may provide empirical evidence and theoretical support for further promoting mixed ownership reform. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Purpose: Family business has been widely discussed in the literature. Still, a holistic approach summarizing the family business concept in entrepreneurship is fragmented to date. This paper aims to explore the multimedia view of family business research in entrepreneurship and finds the key theme discussed by researchers. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, a systematic literature review on family business and its role in entrepreneurship have been conducted. The literature review consists of bibliometric and content analyzes. Bibliometric research offers quantitative insights, whereas content analysis provides the qualitative evaluation of the literature. Findings: The findings suggest that recent research in this area focuses on exploring the role of women entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurship in the family business. The literature also finds that because of the nature of family businesses, successors get the opportunity to use their family’s network, social status, financing and opportunity toward a well-developed market. Research limitations/implications: This paper may help researchers and practitioners to identify the past and current research trends related to family business and entrepreneurship. Originality/value: The concepts from network theory are applied for content analysis to identify and explore various family business and entrepreneurship literature sub-domains. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Corporate investment efficiency is always related to its operational stability. The intensification of environmental uncertainty makes it more difficult for enterprises to accurately learn market conditions，resulting in deviations in investment decisions. In particular，the uncertainty also brings about problems such as over-investment or underinvestment，which greatly affects corporate investment efficiency and is not conducive to high-quality economic growth. In recent years，the Chinese government has put forward a series of measures to optimize the business environment of enterprises，such as tax reduction，cost reduction，high convenience and strong supervision. However，relying on external governance alone is not enough. Therefore，this paper attempts to explore ways to improve investment efficiency from the perspective of enterprises themselves. Based on the perspective of the insurance effect of operational stability，this paper empirically analyzes the internal relationship among corporate social responsibility，environmental uncertainty and investment efficiency. Based on the panel data of Chinese listed enterprises，this paper finds that corporate social responsibility helps to reduce the degree of investment deviation and improve the investment efficiency. Moreover，there is an insurance effect mechanism in the corporate social responsibility，which promotes the improvement of corporate investment efficiency by reducing environmental uncertainty. Further research finds that the insurance effects of different types of corporate social responsibility undertakings to achieve operational stability are different，which in turn has the heterogeneous influence on corporate investment efficiency. It is embodied in the fact that corporate social responsibility has a strong effect on family enterprises and non-state-owned enterprises. Based on the discussion of the heterogeneous influence of the difference between corporate financing constraints and business risks，it is found that the corporate social responsibility behavior of the low-constraint group and the low-risk group has a great effect on the improvement of their corporate investment efficiency. Corporate social responsibility has a small effect on corporate investment efficiency by improving the level of financing constraints through signaling mechanism and reputation mechanism. It improves investment efficiency more by winning extensive social networks and rich political resources for enterprises，reducing the uncertainty of the external operating environment. In addition，differences in business risks lead to changes in the cost of social responsibility and the allocation of resources，which in turn aggravates the burden on enterprises themselves， making the insurance effect of corporate social responsibility in high-risk groups invalid. Compared with the previous literature，the marginal contribution of this paper is mainly reflected in the following aspects. First，based on the data of Chinese enterprises，this paper tests the effect of corporate social responsibility on improving the investment efficiency，and finds that it has an insurance effect of stable operation，which can help persuade enterprises to actively undertake social responsibility in theory. It provides a practical path and empirical evidence for improving the stability of enterprise operation and the efficiency of enterprise investment，which has important practical significance. Second，this paper discusses the impact of corporate social responsibility on investment efficiency from the perspective of corporate behavior and decision-making，and further explores the insurance effect mechanism.

AB  - Purpose: While pursuing energy management, firms simultaneously strive to boost sales as a path towards economic performance. Also, the literature suggests that family firms exhibit greater environmental commitment than their non-family counterparts. To examine these contentions, this review espouses contingency theory to interrogate the correlations of (1) energy consumption targets, (2) energy efficiency enhancing measures, (3) energy consumption monitoring and (4) the domestic sales performance of small family firms in Turkey's food sector. Design/methodology/approach: Data were sourced from the World Bank Enterprise Survey. A sample of 137 family firms in food production, processing and retail was analysed using non-linear structural equation modelling. Path coefficients were determined to estimate the extent to which energy management practices predict domestic sales. Findings: The path analysis revealed that although energy consumption targets do not directly increase sales performance, they stimulate firms' energy efficiency enhancement measures and energy consumption monitoring to produce this effect by 21%. Research limitations/implications: The contingency lens espoused leaves room to capture further antecedents in small family food firms' technical, managerial, ownership, operational and architectural configuration that may also interact with or predict the propensity for energy management. Practical implications: For practitioners, the inherent findings demonstrate that there are firm-specific material benefits arising from adopting energy management practices. And, although small firms such as family food businesses may have low energy intensities, they can improve their sales performance by setting energy targets, installing energy efficiency enhancing measures and embarking on energy consumption monitoring. Social implications: Public stakeholders in Turkey such as the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, the General Directorate of Energy Affairs and affiliate institutions can reflect on these findings to develop a coherent national energy management policy for small firms. Such initiatives are especially relevant to Turkey and its ambitions to join the EU which requires member states to set up a national energy efficiency action plan. Originality/value: This inquiry is one of the first to examine energy management in the food sector at the family firm level through the contingency lens. Theoretically, the results draw attention and shed new light on disparate energy management practices and their discrete yet substantial contribution to sales performance. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In this study, we explore how a unique social institution, the family business, contributes to the transition from latent to emergent entrepreneurship by shaping the entrepreneurial intentions of the next generation. In line with the family embeddedness perspective, we argue that the enterprising family and the family enterprise, as two intertwined units of analysis pertaining to the family business context, influence the intention to found a new venture or succeed in the family business. Using an international sample of 40,508 students with a family business background, our findings reveal which specific factors related to either the family or the business explain next generation's preferences for succeeding over founding. The results extend our understanding of the role played by institutions in knowledge spillover theory and contribute to family business research on the succession process and its determinants. © 2021

AB  - Although family businesses and social enterprises are typically examined as distinct organizational forms, research in both domains recognizes the significant influence of family on organizational goals. Our cross-disciplinary review of 104 articles, published in 50 journals between 1996 and 2020, capitalizes on this family connection and synthesizes the varied ways family influence has been examined in extant literature. Our review considers the role of the family in shaping social missions and directing social value while also emphasizing the importance of community stakeholders. Our findings provide a foundation for understanding the dynamic role of family influence across domains and enhancing interdisciplinary learning. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The matter of sustainable food production is a convoluted one; it is inexorably linked with ethics, ideology, economic and political arguments, corporate power contrasted with sole enterprises, traditional ways of life and so on. This includes widely publicised issues, such as those of vegetarian and vegan ethics, discourses and realities of animal cruelty, environmental protection, access to clean water and unpolluted land—and by extension, mining, mass exploitation, industrialisation and land ownership by powerful groups and individuals. Among the latter, weighty stakeholder groups, including state actors, justifications of post/industrial, quasi/scientific experimentation and the spectre of genetic modification are used as arguments for progress, eradication of hunger, reach/supply, distribution, cost-effectiveness and access to sustenance among the poor. At the heart of the ideological discourses underpinning all this are the notions of freedom, utility and choice, as axiomatically inherent concepts of neoliberal thought so deeply embedded in the past 40 years of state and supra-state policies that the neoliberal brand of policymaking, business strategy and their very logos as thought, seems discerned only by those initiated in the breach between multiple parties involved, and thus seldom questioned. Food, land, water and air as the most fundamental needs—and rights—of human and non-human life are the subjects that arouse passion in many—including advocates, activists, farmers and producers—and the detached, utilitarian elaborations of those currently holding dominant positions that cross geographical, organisational and economic strata. This text explores contemporary practices and positions concerning traditional, sustainable and health-promoting food production in Serbia against the backdrop of international, national and local contexts of socio-political, environmental, economic and industrial significance. Fieldwork, conducted online during the pandemic finds that food production in Serbia largely fits within the forceful global patterns, with health food producers displaying a traditional/reflective slant but are by no means backward in their ethically driven stance. Indeed, a critical rethink of agriculture and health priorities appears to permeate Serbian discourse across ideological and socioeconomic spectrums. Young professional families appear to be embracing health food lifestyles and village life. Arguably though, this relates to the wealthier minority able to make such choices. Scarred by the turbulent century behind it and civil strife awarded by unremitting structural transition, Serbians redefine their sense of Self by either embracing or angrily rejecting tradition and family values. Such patterns are not unfamiliar to the affluent West. Yet, here they tend to define everyday life in a different way, impacting on health, community and civic duty. Discursive drives range from mining to re-industrialisation, enduring impact of the tumultuous Nineties, ‘modernising’ regulatory frameworks, imported anticompetitive practices and from resistance to the extinction of inherited egalitarian notions to the capillary attempts to reclaim communal prerogatives. Organisational, regulatory and policy challenges surface, and this essay contextualises those recounted by practitioners, the public and key scholars in such complex circumstances. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This paper studies the impact of demographic factors on the performance of women-owned micro-enterprises in North India. Data were collected from 100 women entrepreneurs through self-structured questionnaire using stratified random sampling technique. Sales turnover and net profit margin are taken as dependent variables. Multivariate regression analysis was applied to study the impact of various demographic factors. The results indicate registration status, legal ownership, nature of business, age, education, family income, size of business and employees positively affect the net profits and sales turnover of the enterprises. However, the numbers of products offered have a negative effect on the sales and net profits margin. The factors identified in this study, which have a positive impact on the net profits and sales turnover, are important in making entrepreneurial decisions that can enhance the performance and may help for economical production. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Digital technologies are increasingly affecting industries worldwide in many ways. Although the adoption of digital technologies by firms has been studied extensively from a technical point of view, previous research lacks insight into the managerial aspects of digital transformation, which, given the transformation’s interdisciplinarity, might have substantial implications for information systems research. In particular, it is unclear how small and medium-sized family-controlled firms (known as family-owned Mittelstand firms) with resource constraints handle digital transformation. This paper addresses this gap by drawing on rich data from 127 semi-structured interviews in a multiple case study of 15 family-owned Mittelstand firms from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. All of these firms are active in the manufacturing industry but vary in terms of their digital transformation progress. Based on within-case and cross-case pattern analysis, we propose that the digital transformation of Mittelstand firms is a process consisting of three stages, namely, process digitalisation, product and service digitalisation, and business model digitalisation, and we reveal triggers for each stage and the dynamic capabilities needed throughout this process. Moreover, we identify three combinations of enablers and barriers that support or hinder the development of dynamic capabilities and thus accelerate or impede the advancement of the digital transformation process. © Operational Research Society 2021.

AB  - India is witnessing rapid progress in the twenty-first century. The progress unfortunately is very uneven and non-inclusive. Many people are below the poverty line and often have to do without sufficient food. Many children do get the benefit of primary education. Girls and women do not get adequate nutrition or equal opportunities of education and employment. In healthcare, in particular, we see a major disparity in the facilities available to different sections of society in India. A privileged few get access to sophisticated, advanced healthcare facilities while the poor in urban slum areas and especially in rural India either have no access to good quality basic healthcare or cannot afford them. A lot of social enterprises in India are using smart innovative technology to solve this problem of making available quality healthcare to the urban poor and the needy rural in India at affordable rates. Objective The paper studies two social enterprises, the first being AAarogyaVedh Healthcare InfoTech Pvt. Ltd. which provides cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the second being a family owned social enterprise that offers a juggad ambulance cum medical unit called AmbuPod that uses innovative technology to make available quality and economical healthcare in a timely manner. Research Methodology The researchers have conducted personal interviews by way of primary research. They have also availed of secondary resources. Significance of the Study The study will encourage enterprises to use technology in order to provide for high grade healthcare available to everyone in India. It will inspire decision makers, NGOs, and business entities to help such social enterprises. The study also brings out the fact that these social enterprises not only provide crucial services like cost-effective measures for creating physical, mental, or emotional well-being (health care), but also create job opportunities. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Controlling is considered a tool that increases the quality of corporate management. At present, it is very important to perceive controlling not only as a quick control tool but especially as a tool that helps an enterprise to achieve its objectives, to meet its vision, to adopt adequate strategies, thereby also directly improving the economic results and the long-term competitiveness of the enterprise. The aim of the study is to compare the use of controlling, such as a tool of competitiveness in family and non-family businesses in transition economies. The issue was mapped in the territory of the Visegrad Four (V4) by means of an empirical survey by the method of a questionnaire. The sample consisted of 405 family and non-family businesses from Slovakia, Poland, Czech Republic, and Hungary. The hypotheses were tested using the Test of the difference between two proportions. At the same time, due to the better interpretation of the achieved results, the statistical method of the Interval estimate of the population proportion has been applied. The results have shown that there are significant differences in the use of controlling tools in family and non-family businesses. The major differences have been found out in the area of financial controlling, namely the application of profitability and liquidity indicators, and investment controlling in using net present value. © 2022, Czestochowa University of Technology.

AB  - Purpose: This contribution appraises previous theoretical underpinnings that are focused on family businesses in tourism and hospitality. It discusses about the opportunities and challenges for their development. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was carried out through peer-reviewed publications that were indexed in Scopus and Web of Science. It relied on the PRISMA protocol to evaluate rigorous articles and reviews. A content analysis sheds light on high impact contributions on “family business” and “tourism” or “hospitality”, which were published since 2010. Findings: This bibliographic research captured, analyzed and synthesized the findings from previous contributions to identify the factors that are facilitating the growth prospects, long-term sustainability and innovative approaches of family businesses within the tourism and hospitality industry. Originality/value: Currently, there are just a few contributions that advance relevant knowledge and understanding on the business development of family firms in tourism and hospitality. This research addresses this academic gap as these entities constitute the life blood of tourist destinations in various contexts. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - While there is a tradition of viewing both craftwork and entrepreneurship as characteristically individualistic and autonomous activities, this article examines the way in which social ties of family and kinship are often integral to many entrepreneurial ventures. Instead of a neat divide between ‘separate spheres’, work and home permeate each other in meaningful ways. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 20 workers from UK craft gin distilleries, this article explores how kinship and intimacy are put to work in craft enterprises. Findings show that the involvement of family and kin is vital to the operations of many craft businesses. Working together with spouses and siblings brings benefits and challenges and involves negotiating task and role allocation, often through invoking heteronormative notions of suitability and complementarity. Such concerns are bound up with how family and kin are understood by participants. Their reflections on entrepreneurial kinship involve both narratives of work and visions of a lifestyle which are both familial and entrepreneurial. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Purpose: In this study, we investigated the dilemma of devising an operational family business definition in the SME context. The existing family business literature mostly agrees with the validity of a theoretical model called F-PEC, which identifies family businesses by evaluating three dimensions: power, experience, and culture. Nonetheless, empirical studies on family SMEs still use just one or a few elements with many different thresholds to operationally define family SMEs, highlighting an unsolved definitional divergence among scholars, which limits the possibility of investigating the potential effects of family attributes on firms’ goals, structures, processes, and performance. Design/methodology/approach: Employing ancestry searching, online databases, and issue-by-issue searches from two decades (1990–2019), we analyzed 255 empirical studies that specified a family business’s operational definition (despite posing different research questions) and used a sample of small-sized and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Findings: Results showed ownership and governance/management are the most used elements in the operational definitions provided in the literature to date, but that there still is not a universally adopted operational definition of family SMEs in use today. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first to comprehensively analyze and review the operationalized use of family SME definitions in the literature. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper uses an in-depth qualitative case study of a family-owned emerging market multinational enterprise (EMMNE), specializing in digital and electronic media, to explore how EMMNEs can potentially leverage their technological, cultural, and relational capabilities to deliver superior business and relationship quality outcomes for its clients. An in-depth analysis reveals how this EMMNE transformed its business model. Furthermore, building on a firm's resource-based view (RBV), specifically, dynamic capabilities, this research examines how this EMMNE leveraged its cultural and relational capabilities and created a social and values-based context through HRM practices suited for its contextual conditions. Such a context and organizational capabilities collectively enabled business model innovation to deliver sustained value to its clients domestically and in other emerging markets. We discuss our findings and conclude with implications for theory and practice. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.
